            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Readers, I was born in <hi>Segovia,</hi> a City of the Province of <hi>Caſteele,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Spain:</hi> My Fathers name was <hi>Yſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi> Native of the ſame City and by Trade a Barber; but ſuch was his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that he was much troubled, when any one called him Barber, and would reply, he was a Circumciſer of Hairs, and a Metamorphoſer of Beards: His Wife, who as I believe, was my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was called <hi>Roguille.</hi> It was the opinion of moſt of the Neighbourhood, that ſhe was of the race of the <hi>Jews:</hi> ſhe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115509:6"/>was of indifferent good behaviour, and tolerably handſom, and for that reaſon, moſt of the Poets and Rimers of <hi>Spain</hi> made copies of pleaſant Verſes upon her. When ſhe was firſt married, as alſo ſome time after, ſhe had many vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations; for ſome of our Neighbours tongues were ſo laviſh as to report, that ſhe had changed the Roman I of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name into a Greek Y. He poor man was accuſed, and in fine convicted, that at any time when he ſhaved his Cuſtomers, or dreſs'd his Patients a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Groin, holding up their noſes aloft, a young Brother of mine about ſeven years old, was wont very dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to pick their pockets; but that poor little Angel, (peace be with him) dyed in priſon, under the pennance of a diſcipline which was applied to him with a little too much rigour. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was very much afflicted at it, for that he drove a pretty trade with him: he had often times before his death, and never ſo much as once after, been Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115509:6"/>but as I have been told, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways was delivered with a great deal of honour, accompanied by people of all conditions. I have heard too, that the women uſed to be Spectators at their windows of this Comedy; I ſpeak it not by way of vain-glory, for every one knows, I am not that way inclin'd.</p>
                  <p>To return unto my Mother; Once upon a time, an old woman, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended me in the nature of a Nurſe, ſaid unto me by way of commendation of her, ſhe had ſo many attractions, that ſhe had bewitched every one who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented her company; knew how to ſoder up a crack'd Mayden-head, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive loſt love, and to renew old age: Some called her the Bone-ſetter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>located affections, and otherſome of the more vulgar ſort, ſtiled her in plain Engliſh, Bawd, and ſaid that ſhe play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all Games for money: but for her part, ſhe ſmil'd at them all, that ſhe might the better ſnap them, when they came within her Duckquey. I ſhall not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115509:7"/>ſcruple to tell you, the pennance ſhe did undergo; ſhe had a Chamber into which no one went but her ſelf, which to ſay the truth, was much like a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel-houſe, being full of ſinners bones, which, to make uſe of her own phraſe, ſhe kept to put her in mind of mortality, and to make her deſpiſe life; it was garniſh'd about with Images of wax, <hi>Vervain, Hern,</hi> and other herbs of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Eve, of which ſhe made ſtrange compoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Upon a certain day a diſpute hapned between may Father and her, unto which of their two Trades I ſhould betake my ſelf, but I who from my youth, had always generous and noble thoughts, would not addict my ſelf to either one or t'other of them. My Son, ſaid my Father unto me, the Proreſſion of a Thief is one of the liberal Sciences, and doth not at all relliſh of the mechanick, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the handicraft: the honeſteſt men do now adayes make it their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and who ſo ſteals not, knows
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115509:7"/>not how to live in this world; and why think you I pray do their Serjeants and Bayliffs ſo perſecute us? only becauſe one Trade envies another: why do they baniſh us, why whip; and hang us up? (I can ſcarce proceed any farther without weeping, for the good old man cryed like a child at the remembrance of the ſundry times his ſhoulders had been bruſh'd) it is, becauſe they would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no other Theeves but themſelves to cohabite with them: but providential craft doth ſometimes deliver us out of their clutches. In my youth, I uſually walked the Churches, and other places of publique meetings, and though I was ſometimes ſnap'd, yet I ſtill got off by my wits, which were good at a dead lift; ſo that by this handicraft, I have maintain'd both thy Mother and ſelf, in very good faſhion: How, Bleſſing of me, quoth my Mother, all in a rage, doeſt thou offer to ſay thou haſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mee? thou lieſt, It is I, who have provided bread for thee, at the coſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115509:8"/>of my own fleſh, and who have divers times drawn thee out of priſon, by my own induſtry, and tell me now by your faith, when you were put to the Rack, and that you that confeſs'd nothing, did it proceed from the ſtrength of your courage, or thoſe Broaths I made you, which coſt me no ſmall ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? No, no, you are an unworthy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful wretch, and did I not fear ſome one in the Street might hear me, I could remember you of a time when I got by the Chimney into a Chamber, when you were once ſnap'd as in a Rat-trap, and brought you out like a cat through a Garret window. More ſhe had ſaid, (for ſhe was very much provoked) had ſhe not amidſt the violence of her paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on broken the ſtring of her Beads, which were of dead mens teeth, who ſhe had made away, which ſhe began to pick up. Now I, that I might neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate one nor t'other, I reſolutely told them I would follow goodneſs and my own vertuous inclinations; to which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115509:8"/>end I deſired them to ſend me to School, that I might learn to write. That pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of mine ſeem'd very reaſonable unto them, however they left not off quarrelling between themſelves; My Mother betook her ſelf to threading her Beades of teeth, my Father he went to ſhave one, but whether of his beard or purſe I know not; for my part, I was left all alone, and began to thank my Starrs, that I was born of two ſo illuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſo ingenuous perſons, and ſo ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous of my good education.</p>

Now to let you ſee, that I had ever a good courage, I began from that time, to keep company with thoſe, who were bigger then my ſelf, inſomuch that I became intimate with a Cavaliers ſon of the City, whoſe name was <hi>Don Alonſo de Sougniga.</hi> We ate and drank toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Every Holy-day I went to play with him; to be ſhort, I was never out of his company; whereupon the other Scholars, either angry, that I ſlighted them, or deſirous of correcting my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, would be ever and anon twitting me in the teeth with my Fathers Trade. One called me Lord of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer, Maſter of the Cupping-Glaſſes, and Diaculum, another laid it in my Diſh that my Mother had debauched two of his Siſters; a third, that my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115509:10"/>had been ſent for to his houſe to drive away the Rats, as much as to ſay, he was a Cat, with many the like injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpeeches, and though I was not a little nettled at thoſe indignities, yet I ſeem'd not to regard them, until upon a certain day, one of my Comerades with whom I fell out at play, called me Son of a whore, and witch; now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſpoke it ſo plainly that every one heard it, (for had he ſpoken a little ſoftlier peradventure I ſhould have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken no notice of it) I threw a ſtone ſo hard at him, that I broke his head, whereupon away ran I to my Mother, to acquaint her with what had paſs'd; who anſwered me, well haſt thou done my Son, thou now ſheweſt who thou art, only thou wert to blame for not asking him who told him ſo. I hearing that, and having always my wits about me, anſwered her I was only vexed, that ſome then preſent, had told me I had no reaſon to be ſo angry, and that I had not asked them, whether they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115509:10"/>ſaid ſo in regard of the boyes childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; thereupon I deſired of her to let me know, whether I might give him the lye, whether I was extraordinarily begotten, or the Son of my reputed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. How quoth ſhe ſmiling, art thou already ſo <hi>ſubtile and inquiſitive?</hi> By my troth, I ſee thou art wiſer then I thought thee to be: well haſt thou done to revenge thy ſelf, thou oughteſt to have broken his pate; for feeing thoſe things are done in ſecret, it is a ſign that they ſhould not be publiſh'd: with that I was ſtruck dumb as a Bell-founder, when he runs his mettle, and reſolved to get whatever I could finger in the houſe, and to betake my ſelf to the wide world, to ſee how great an Empire Honour had already obtained over me! however I diſſembled my intention; away went my Father to ſeek out the Boy, that he might wipe off this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, who asked him forgiveneſs, and ſo peace being made, I was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the School, where at firſt my
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115509:11"/>Maſter received me in great anger, but having conſidered what provocations I had, he abated his fury.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt I remained there, I was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and anon viſited by that Scholar with whom I before told you, I had contracted a great friendſhip: his name was <hi>Don Diego,</hi> and he had a particular kindneſs for me; I uſed to exchange my Giggs and Tops with him, though mine were the better of the two. I gave him part of my junkets which I brought to School, and never asked any of him. I preſented him alſo with Pictures, in fine I became ſo complaiſant to every of his humours, that at laſt his Father and Mother who knew nothing of the ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of mine, ſeeing their child took ſuch delight in my company, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well pleaſed when I did dine, ſupp, or lye with <hi>Don Diego,</hi> Withal I was very courteous to ſuch as viſited me, nature having befriended me with a countenance and ſhape which every one thought to be indifferent handſome.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115509:11"/>Now it ſo fell out upon a day juſt after the Chriſtmas Holy-dayes, that we going together to School, met with one whoſe name was <hi>Ponce d' Aguire,</hi> a rag of the Law, who was not very well in his wits: Let us call yon fellow <hi>Ponce Pilate,</hi> quoth little <hi>Diego,</hi> and then run away; I to content my friend did ſo, before he had quite deſired it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the man became ſo furious, that he ran after me with a knife in his hand, reſolv'd to kill me, inſomuch that I was forced to double my pace, and ſave my ſelf in the School-houſe under my Maſter; preſently in came the man and fell upon me, but my Maſter took him off, and promiſed to whip me ſoundly; and although my Miſtreſs came to my relief, and begg'd my pardon, in regard of the good offices I did her, yet he forthwith cauſed me to untruſs, and whipping me, at every laſh, would ask me, will you any more ſay <hi>Pontius Pilate?</hi> and I anſwered crying, No Sir, inſomuch that having once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115509:12"/>renewed my promiſe to him, and he bethinking the great puniſhment I had received, forbore further correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It ſo fell out that the next morn, whileſt we were ſaying the Creed, and our other Prayers, as we dayly uſed, when I came to thoſe words, who ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> I remembred my fault, and ſaid, who ſuffered under <hi>Pontius d' Aguire,</hi> to ſee my Innocency, my Maſter ſeeing my great ſimplicity, could not forbear laughing, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently promiſed me to forgive me the two firſt faults I ſhould commit, and though they deſerved the laſh, yet that I ſhould not be whipp'd. I could not but be well pleaſed therewith.</p>
                  <p>It was then neer about the time for chuſing of Kings, and my Maſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to give ſome recreations to his Schollars, reſolved to make a Royalty. The cake was divided, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Bean came to my ſhare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any artifice. Forthwith I acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my Father and Mother, that they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115509:12"/>might provide me clothes and trinkets The day of triumph being come, I was mounted upon a Rocinant of <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> a perfect Enchanters Horſe, the leaneſt that was ever ſeen, his Chine was at leaſt a quarter of a mile long, and withal ſo humble, that more could not be, for he went making of Reverences; he had but one eye, a neck like a Camel, and a tail like an Ape, that is without any tail at all. To be ſhort, he was a dumb witneſs who accuſed his Maſter of the auſtere life, and the many faſting dayes he forced him to keep, by detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the better half of his ſuſtenance from him. Mounted I was upon this ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Barb, attended by all the reſt of my School-fellows, dreſſed up in the moſt egregious Ornaments their Mothers could procure for them. In this gallant Equipage we paſſed through the market place; I aſſure you I cannot yet but ſhake for very fear, whileſt I think of it; for coming neer the Herb-womens ſtalls, <hi>Libera nos Domine,</hi> from their fury!
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115509:13"/>my hunger-ſtarv'd Horſe, fell upon a Basket of Coleworts, and forthwith devoured them, ſtuffing his Guts, and not a little overjoyed with ſo pleaſant a bait. The Herb-woman, whoſe cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts they were; being a ſort of women as impudent as Oyſter-wives, began to cry after me with open mouth, at which the whole tribe of them ran flocking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, with a number of canting Beggers and Porters, who ſnatching up their handfulls of great Turnips and Onions out of the Hampers, fell to pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the poor King, who knew not what ſhift to make. And I ſeeing it was a Turn-up combate, had a good mind to turn-down, but at that very inſtant, one of thoſe cuckoldly Rogues gave my horſe ſo great a charge upon the noſe, that he began to ſtand on end, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none of the ſtrongeſt fell backwards together with my worſhip, not upon dry land, but with reverence be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, into a bottomleſs Jakes, which to my misfortune was there at hand. I
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115509:13"/>give you leave to gueſs with your ſelf; how ſweetly I was pickled. Amidſt this ſcufle, my Companions armed by this, in their Kings defence, broke two of the herb-womens necks: In came the Officers, who ſeized upon the Herb-women, and ſuch Scholars and arms, as they could catch; for my Subjects had made uſe of their weapons in an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive way, which they intended only for ſhew, as Daggers, Swords and Spears.</p>
                  <p>At length, the Serjeants came to me, who though I had no arms, they hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been taken into a houſe, together with my Hat and Royal Robe to be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet did they not forbear to demand them, whereunto I anſwered all beſhit as I was; that I had none offenſive as to matter of life, but only to the ſenſe of ſmelling. How ever my worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief Actor in the Tragedy, the Catchpole-rogue, would needs have me away to priſon, but he was forced to leave me there, for that he knew not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115509:14"/>to lay hands on me I was ſo bedawbed. Some went one way, ſome another, and at laſt home got I affronting every ones noſe I met. Being got home, I related my misfortune to my Father and Mother, but they inſtead of laughing, were ſo inraged to ſee me in ſuch a ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, that they reſolved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow a good beating upon me. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to plead my excuſes the beſt I could, by laying the whole fault on the horſe, which they had lent me, but finding all was to little purpoſe, away ran I to <hi>Don Diego,</hi> who was newly come home with a cut in his head, which he receiv'd in the fray, which made his Father and Mother conclude not to ſend him any more to School.</p>
                  <p>By this, one came and brought me newes of poor Rocinant, he told me, how he had ſeen him in ſuch extremity, that he was conſtrained to make a virtue of neceſſity, and by often plunging to get out of that villainous ſlough, had broken his Girts, Breaſt-plate, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115509:14"/>Crupper, and ſo remained ready to breath his laſt in that golden Myne. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that all our ſport ended in a Turd, and that all the market was in an uproar, my Father and Mother at their wits ends to think of paying for the horſe, and my friend wounded, I made a vow never to go to School more, nor indeed to my Fathers houſe, but to keep cloſe with <hi>Don Diego,</hi> to wait upon him, or to ſpeak more truely, to keep him company to his Father and Mothers great content, for they knew their Son did love me very dearly. In order to this deſign I ſent home word, that I had no more need to go to School, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed though I could not write well, yet I could do well enough for a Cavalier; which profeſſion I propoſed to my ſelf to imitate, amongſt whom, to write ill and pay worſe, are two great vertues, and for that reaſon I would forſake the School, to eaſe them of their charge, and their houſe to rid them of my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I acquainted them with the place
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115509:15"/>of my abode, aſſuring them, I ſhould never return to them any more, without their permiſſion pre-obtained.</p>

                  <p>Behold us now, under the tuition and Government of this gallant Perſon. At our firſt coming, he appointed us a Chamber, and read us a Laconique Lecture, that he might not looſe too much time, for every thing went through his hands. He ſet us our day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly task, which laſted till Supper-time. It was his cuſtom, that when our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were at meat, we their Servants waited upon them, which was none of the greateſt works, for indeed there were not above five boarders, they being young, and Gentlemens ſons of the Countrey. The firſt thing which came under my obſervation, was, that therè
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115509:17"/>was never a cat in the houſe, I deſired to know the reaſon of it, and addreſſed my ſelf to an old Servant in the houſe, who was nothing but skin and bones; he half weeping ſaid unto me, from whom have you ever learn'd that cats were lovers of Faſtings, or ſuch auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities as are here uſed? One may ſee by your gaping, that you are a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commer; you cannot imagine, what an afflictive impreſſion this reply made upon me, our good Maſter the Doctor ſate him down, and having ſaid Grace, they made a dinner like eternity, for it had neither beginning nor ending: they had broath brought unto the Table in little wooden Saucers ſo tranſparent, that had <hi>Narciſſus</hi> been there, he had run the ſame danger of being drowned, as at the Fountain. I obſerved how induſtriouſly the Penſioners lean fingers were playing upon the Virginals, as it were, to ſnap up a poor pea, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſave himſelf, ſometimes by ſwimming, and ſometimes by diving.

The Divel take you thought I to my ſelf, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in came a Servant, more like a Ghoſt then a body, ſo ſhin he was, who brought with him a diſh of meat (which ſeemed to have been cut off from his own body) with a Turnip upon it, ſet out like a grand Sallet, how quoth the Doctor, here's a Turnip according to my own wiſh, for my part, I think there is no Patridge like it; eat, eat, my Lads, it does me good to ſee you feed ſo heartily, with that he cut every one a little piece, ſo little indeed, that I think I may ſafely ſwear, there ſtuck as much in either of their Nayls and teeth, as went into their Bellies. <hi>Ragot</hi> obſerved them ſaying, cheer up, you
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115509:18"/>are young, and I rejoyce to ſee you have ſuch good ſtomacks, conſider I pray you, what good entertainment this was for ſuch as gaped for very hunger.</p>
                  <p>They made an end of eating, and there remained upon the Table, nothing but a few ſcraps and bones, which our Doctor ſeeing, there quoth he, there's for our Servants, who are like to make as good a Dinner as their Maſters. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given God thanks, let us riſe ſaid he, and make room for them; as for you, get you to play until two of the clock, that what you have eaten may the better digeſt in your ſtomacks. A pox on thee ſaid I to my ſelf, and for very anger began to ſmile, which the Doctor perceiving, gave me a check, and bid me learn modeſty, and ſo ended with three or four old ſentences upon that Subject. I did not forbear to ſit down at Table, with the reſt of the Servants, and being older then ſome, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then others, I began to lay about me with both my hands, and that ſo nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115509:19"/>of Office ſtood, who told me, there was not any about the houſe, but ſaid, if you have for once occaſion to make uſe of any ſuch place, you may do it where you pleaſe; for during two months that I have been here, I never went to Stool but once, and then too, it was the effect of what I brought in my belly from my Fathers houſe, which peradventure may have befallen you this day.</p>
                  <p>I cannot fully acquaint you with the anguiſh in which I found my ſelf, when he made me this ſad accompt. In ſhort, perceiving ſo little was to paſs into my belly, I durſt not let any thing go out, though I had a great deſire. Being in this pain, comes <hi>Don Diego</hi> to me, and asked me what Rhetorique he ſhould uſe, to perſwade his guts that they were well ſtuffed, for that they would not at that time believe him. In this houſe there was an Epidemical complaint of wind Collicks, as in others, of crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and repletion: Supper-time came,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115509:19"/>(for as for afternoon's lunſhions, there was no ſuch thing known,) we made a light Supper, ſuch almoſt as Cameleons uſe; a little of an old roſted Goat, was our whole Bill of fare, there is not any thing ſaid our Doctor, more conducing to health then not to overcharge the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, he made ſeveral Encomiums up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diet, and recited ſome Aphoriſms of the Doctors; alledging that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented ill dreams: The truth is, with him I think no one ever did dream, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that he were eating, ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous were we of it; to be ſhort, every one ſupped without ſupping; and ſo went to bed. <hi>Don Diego</hi> and my ſelf, could not ſhut our eyes that whole night; we had not any of thoſe ſweet fumes, which proceeding from meat, cauſe ſleep, inſomuch that we were at leiſure to contrive a letter of complaint unto his Father, with an humble ſupplication to deliver him from the jawes of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Some things I inſerted, Sir ſaid I, you cannot well tell whether we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115509:20"/>are alive or not, for I am of opinion, that we dyed at the Battle of the Herb-women, and that we are now only Souls in Purgatory, without foolery, write unto your Father to deliver us. Amidſt our diſcourſe it became day, the clock ſtroak ſix, and our Maſter called us up to our Books, I was almoſt at my wits end, whileſt I was making my ſelf rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for I found my doublet and hoſe a great deal to big for me, I began to ſuſpect ſome one had changed my clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, but one of my fellow-Servants told me, ſuch accidents uſually hapened in that houſe, for that he had ſeen a cart-horſe brought thither and preſently tranſform'd into a Light-horſe, ſo thin ſhaped, that he might have flown in the air; as alſo great fat Maſtiffs turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Grey-hounds; and that one day he ſaw ſeveral men, who put ſome their feet, ſome their hands, and others their whole bodies but only within the houſe doors, and having asked what good they found in it, it was anſwered, one

                  <p>Whileſt we were expecting for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very from <hi>Don Diego</hi>'s Father, and found no way to ſtuff out our Doublets, we concluded together not to riſe ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morning, which to effect, we counterfeited our ſelves to be ſick, but we durſt not ſay we had a Fever, for ſo by feeling our Pulſe we ſhould have bin diſcovered, nor that we had the tooth-ach, or head-ach, for then they would have laughed at us: we reſolved then to complain of the belly-ach, for that we had not been at ſtool for three dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, imagining our Maſter would not put himſelf to a farthing charge, to any cure for us: but the Devil would ſo have it, that it fell out quite contrary, <hi>Ragot</hi> had a receipt derived to him from his Father, who had been an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> now upon our relating our griefs, he

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115509:21"/>me, and held me down per-force, whileſt the old woman accomodated her Pipe; ſhe had no ſooner done her feat, but I did mine too, for I let all goe in her face, which ſo inraged our Maſter, that he ſaid he would turn me out of his houſe, for he ſaw I did it willfully, but it was not my good fortune to be ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. We ſent new complaints to <hi>Don Alonſo,</hi> but <hi>Ragot</hi> prepoſſeſs'd him, that we uſed all thoſe inventions, only to neglect our books, ſo that he was heard and we not. Behold us there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd for a longer time, to undergo the remainder of our miſeries which that old woman did help to compleat upon us: ſhe was ſo deaf, that ſhe heard not any thing, inſomuch as we were forced to diſcourſe with her by Signs, ſhe could ſee but little, and always went mumbling her <hi>Pater-noſter:</hi> once as ſhe was at it by the fire, her Beads broke, and moſt of them fell into the Porridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot, ſhe poor woman perceived it not, and dinner-time being come, ſhe ſerv'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115509:22"/>us up the moſt devout Caudle that ever Zealot ſipp'd. Her Beads were diſhed up like peaſe, one of the Tablers ſaid, here are peaſe in mourning, what kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of theirs is lately dead? No, no quoth another they are Aethiopian peaſe: Beſides all this, ſometimes ſhe miſtook the Fire-ſhovel for the Ladle, I had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times in my Broth, brands-ends, ſticks, Coles and aſhes, which ſhe got out of the chimney. We endur'd all theſe miſeries until <hi>Lent</hi> drew neer, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of which, one of our fellow Penſioners fell ſick. Our Maſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to put himſelf to charge, delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſend for a Phyſician, until the ſick youth called for the Miniſter, thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ſent for a Doctor, who having felt the Patients pulſe, ſaid aloud, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine hath prevented me from being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, of this ſick mans death; his hour was come, at the ſame inſtant he was confeſs'd, and when the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was brought unto him, he cryed out aloud, O my Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115509:22"/>Chriſt, It was neceſſary for me to ſee you come within this houſe, that I might be aſſured I was not in Hell. He had ſcarce ſaid ſo but he dyed: we bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him meanly enough God knowes, for that he was a Stranger. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine, but we were very ſad at this accident.</p>

                     <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> heard of it, and having no other Son but <hi>Don Diego,</hi> he began to believe the Stories we had told him, of <hi>Ragots</hi> cruelties, and to give credit to the relations of the two Ghoſts, for by this we were reduced to a pitiful paſs. In fine, he came to deliver us from thoſe Tyrannies of Famine, under which we were become ſo lean, that although we ſtood before him, he called to have us brought to him, ſo much altered we were. He wanted but a little of ſlaying that perpetual Faſt-monger, but loth to put himſelf to the trouble, he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be patient: He ſent to hire a coach for us, we being ſo lean and feeble, as we were unable to travel. We took
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115509:23"/>our leaves of our School-fellows, who accompanied us with their tears and prayers, like thoſe in <hi>Algiers,</hi> when their fellow-Slaves are redeem'd.</p>

There were Oculiſts ſent for, to ſearch out our eyes, for they were ſo ſunk into our heads, that we ſtood in need of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to ſcrue them up again. For my own particular, I had been hardlier u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed then <hi>Don Diego,</hi> and hunger had
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115509:23"/>wrought more powerfully on me, for that I was treated like a Servant, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it was a good while before they could find where my eyes were; Phyſicians were ſent for, who preſcribed that the duſt of our Books ſhould be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from us with Fox-tails, as they uſe to do unto Pictures, (and indeed there was no ſuch great difference between us and pictures) and then that we ſhould have good Broths made for us; and ſo be well again; Oh what man is able to expreſs the great joy our Bowels receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the firſt diſh of Barley-broth that was brought to us! The Phyſicians or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that no one ſhould talk aloud for nine dayes in our Chamber, becauſe our Stomacks being full of concavities, the leaſt word which was ſpoken, reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like an Eccho, but ſomewhat oftner then that of <hi>Ovid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With thee Obſervations, we began to recruit our former ſtrength, and at four dayes end we ſate up in our beds, yet all this while, we did but look like
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115509:24"/>ſhadows in reſpect of others. We were ſo diſrobed of our fleſh, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſo yellowiſh, that a man would have taken us for walking Ghoſts; we ſpent the day in rendring thanks unto God, for having delivered us from the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of barbarous <hi>Ragot,</hi> and beſeeched him moſt devoutly, to guard all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from his clutches. If whileſt we were at meat, we did by chance think upon the diet of that miſerable Pedant, our appetites would ſo encreaſe upon us, that we ate twice as much: We acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> with <hi>Ragot</hi>'s faſhions, we told him, that at our ſitting down to meals, he uſed to exclaim againſt gluttony, though he had never tryed what it was. In that Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> he compriſed Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies, Partridges, Capons, and all ſort of Birds, of purpoſe, that we might eat none of them; nay he comprehended hunger in it, and ſeemed to make it a caſe of conſcience, whether a man might ſafely kill hunger by eating.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:115509:24"/>
                  <p>Thus we ſpent three months in <hi>Alon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi>'s houſe, but at laſt, we were to turn over a new leaf. The deſire he had to make his Son a Scholar, prevailed with him, to ſend him unto <hi>Alcala;</hi> that there he might go through with what he had commenc'd in the Grammar. He asked of me, whether I would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him. I who had no other paſſion then to be out of that Countrey where our former Belly-perſecutor lived, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that I would moſt willingly continue in his Son's ſervice; thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he provided a Steward to over ſee <hi>Don Diego</hi>'s expences, him he furniſh'd with Bills of exchange. Our clothes were pack'd up, and we put into a coach: An hour before Sun-ſet, we took our leaves, that we might travell in the cool, and about midnight came unto <hi>Viveros,</hi> which place may it be accurſed unto E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity: The Hoſtler was a Moriſco, and a Thief at his fingers ends. Thoſe we term Moriſco's, who are deſcended from the <hi>Moors,</hi> though converted to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115509:25"/>the catholique Faith, and are however vilely ſuſpected of being ſtill <hi>Jews:</hi> I can aſſure you, in all my life I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet hear of ſuch a Monſter, for in the perſon of that man, I ſaw both dog and cat, which yet lived together in fair correſpondence. According to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of ſuch-people, he bid us kindly welcom. Whileſt we were providing to alight out of the Coach, he addreſſed himſelf unto my Maſter, he being the beſt clothed, and gave him his hand to help him out, and then coming to me, asked me whether he was not going to ſtudy? I told him he was, whereupon he brought us into a Chamber, where were two Ruffians, who had no other livelihood, but what they picked up by proſtituring of two Trulls, then with them: In the ſame company was the Parſon of the Pariſh ſaying his Prayers to the tune of their diſcourſe, an old covetous Merchant, who was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to forget his Supper, and two tatter'd Scholars, who were laying their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115509:25"/>wits together how they might inſinuate themſelves into one. My Maſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I ſaid the laſt comer, and but a young man, called to the Maſter of the houſe, ſaying, provide me what you have left, for my ſelf and my two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: We are all your Servants, ſaid the two Hectors, at the ſame inſtant, as we ſhall teſtifie by our endeavours. Ho there, Maſter of the houſe, make the Squire welcome, ſet open your Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try door, and Cupboards, heel'e fee door, and Cupboards, heel'e fee you well paid, and therewithal comes one of them to him, and takes off his cloak, ſaying will you pleaſe to reſt your ſelf? Whileſt they were thus dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in attending him, which I could not but admire at, one of the Nymphs came and accoſted my worſhipful ſelf, ſaying, what a handſom well behaved young Gentleman is this? is he going to the Univerſity? do you belong to him? yes quoth I, and that other man too, pointing at our Steward. What may I call your Maſter? <hi>Don Diego,</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:115509:26"/>Colonel <hi>Don Alonſo</hi>'s Son ſaid I. I had ſcarcely ſaid ſo, before one of the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo's went to him, and with tears in his eyes, imbracing him very affectionately; oh Squire <hi>Diego</hi> ſaid he, who would have thought ſo, it is ten years ſince I ſaw you, wretch that I am! now I ſee I am much altered indeed ſince you have forgotten me. My Maſter was not a little aſtoniſhed at this paſſage, for we both ſwore, we had never ſeen him in our lives. The t'other Swaſh-Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler was walking about my Maſter, and looking him on the face, ſaid to his comerade, making the ſign of the X, is this that Gentleman's Son, whoſe worth you have ſo often cried up? ſurely we are very happy in that we met thus acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally with him, he is grown pretty tall, God bleſs him. This kind of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe had almoſt confounded us, for by their talk one would have thought they had been born and bred with us. <hi>Don Diego</hi> returned him many comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and juſt as he was about to ask
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115509:26"/>him his name, The Hoſt came into the chamber to lay the cloth, and having ſmelt their deſign, Be pleaſed Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to leave off ſtraining of courteſies, until another time, for your Supper ſtayes for you, another time will ſerve for your Complements.</p>
                  <p>He had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but one of the Scholars, began to ſet the chairs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Table, and one at the upper end for Squire <hi>Diego;</hi> t'other brought in a diſh, and ſaid unto my Maſter, will your worſhip be pleaſed to ſit down, we ſhall wait upon you until our Supper be ready; For God's ſake Gentlemen quoth Squire <hi>Diego,</hi> be pleaſed to ſit down likewiſe, and let us ſup together; time enough, time enough ſaid the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo's, whereas my Maſter ſaid not a word to either of them, our cloth is not yet laid. Now I ſeeing ſome invited, and other ſome inviting themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be in a great fear of what might be the ſucceſs. Behold we now the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and roaring boyes all four at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115509:27"/>with my Maſter, who looking him in the face, told him, It were not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom that in the preſence of ſuch a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman, thoſe Ladies ſhould be ſupperleſs; be pleaſed to intreat them to honour the company; whereupon my Maſter roſe up, and invited them to ſit down, which they did at the firſt word, but Good God! how like an aſs did he look amongſt his Gueſts; In a trice they had devoured a great diſh of Coleworts, and made not above four mouthfulls apeice of a loaf which coſt three ſhillings. Then, and there did I find by woful experience, that a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard is no temperate man, when he eats at anothers charge; Then they fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſide of roaſted Goat, and two great cuts of powder'd meat, By this they began to be pretty full, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about they eſpied Maſter Parſon, whoſe eyes were eating as heartily as the beſt of them; whereupon the Scholars roſe up, and turning towards him ſaid, how is your Reverence there, (for in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115509:27"/>
                     <hi>Spain</hi> that is their manner of ſpeech to the Miniſters) be pleaſed to draw neer, The Squires freeneſs and bounty may well reach as far as you too. They had hardly made an end of ſpeaking, but down ſits me Maſter Parſon. Our Steward ſeeing his purſe was like to pay for all, began to ſcratch, where it did not itch, and indeed ſo did I too. Then there was brought to the Table two ribs of roſt Beef, and a couple of Pigeons, they carved half of one of them to <hi>Don Diego,</hi> and then the two Bravo's, the Punks, the Scholars, and Maſter Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon devour'd the reſt in the twinkling of an eye. Thereupon one of the Blades ſaid to him, your worſhip had not beſt to eat any more, for fear of over-char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging your Stomack, it's very true ſaid one of thoſe diveliſh Scholars, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they that go to <hi>Alcala</hi> ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom themſelves unto temperance and ſobriety. Would to God quoth I to my Companion, (curſing of them with all my heart) they would practiſe what
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115509:28"/>they preach, that ſomewhat might fall to our ſhares. When they had eaten up every bit, yet the Curate, a Pox take him, fell to romaging over the bones which they had left, whereupon one of the Hectors turning about, ſaid, what forgetful wretches we were, for we have not left any thing for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, come hither ſaid he, dear hearts, ſpeaking to me and our Steward, you Maſters of the houſe there, here's a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol, let them have what the houſe doth afford, when behold of a ſuddain up comes that damn'd pretended kinſman of my Maſters, and cries out pardon me Sir, if I tell you, you do not well underſtand the world or my Couſin, you do him a great injury, think you he hath not wherewithal to entertain his Servants, I beſeech you put up your money. When I ſaw this Stratagem, I thought I ſhould have dyed for very anger; well, the cloth was taken away, and the Gentlemen took their leaves of my Maſter, ſaying it was high time to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115509:28"/>leave him to his reſt. He would needs pay for the Supper, but they replied, to morrow will be time enough.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt every one of this worſhipful company were retiring unto their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, one of thoſe ragged Scholars ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Merchant faſt aſleep, ſaid unto the Bravo's, have you a mind to laugh a little? Let us play the wag with this old fellow, who hath eaten but one pear all this day. I warrant him a notable rich covetous rogue: you ſay well quoth the Swaſh-bucklers, he deſerves to have a trick put upon him. The Scholar thereupon gets up cloſe to the Merchant, and takes away very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly a little Cloak-bag which lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet; he open'd it, and took out a Box full of Sugar-cakes, which he emptied, and fill'd up again with ſtones and dirt, then he untruſs'd his Breeches and ſhit in the box, upon which he laid about a dozen of thoſe ſhining ſtones which he had took out of a plaiſter-box, which done, he ſhuts the Box. This
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115509:29"/>is not all quoth he, here's a Bottle, we muſt ſee what is in the belly of it: with that he clap'd it to his mouth, and drank it almoſt empty, and then fill'd it with flocks of wool, which he got out of one of the Cuſhions of our Coach; then he put every thing in it's place, and ſo made faſt the Cloak-bag, and not content with that, he put a great ſtone into the hood of the cloak, wherein the Merchant was wrapp'd. Then every one betook him to ſleep for about an hour &amp; half, it being ſo near day-break. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-time once come, every one awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except the old Rogue, who ſlept it out; whereupon one of the company called him, but he intending to riſe, could not get up his cloak, whereupon looking about, he called for the man of the houſe, who came to him, and being pre-acquainted with the jeſt, pretended to be very angry. Why how now ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt friend, could you find nothing in the houſe worth your ſtealing, but this great Stone? Gentlemen, I pray take
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115509:29"/>notice of it, he would have carried it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, had I not found it. I had rather have loſt fifty pound, for it hath an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent virtue againſt the Collick; in the mean time the old man fell a ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wiſhing the Divel had him, if he put it into his Cloak.</p>
                  <p>It was now almoſt time to be jogging. The Hectors made the reckoning, which came to fifteen ſhillings, which we were fain to pay without any more ado, for fear of a worſe miſchief, if we ſhould have had to do with thoſe people. Each man took a bit, before we parted, and the old man got him into a corner with his Cloak-bag under his coat, which he opened to take ſome Comfits out of his Box, of which he eat ſome before he went out of the houſe, but inſtead of what he expected, he put a Stone into his mouth, which beginning to bite, he wanted little of breaking the reſt of thoſe few teeth he had remaining, Preſently he fell a ſpitting and making of mouths, what with the pain, and what with the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115509:30"/>ſtink which he felt in his mouth; we all ran to him to aſſiſt him. Maſter Parſon asked him what ailed him? but inſtead of anſwering him, he fell a ſwearing and curſing; one of the Scholars ſeeming as if he believed he were poſſeſſed with an evil Spirit, called for ſome holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, crying our, <hi>Vade Satanas,</hi> but he preſently declared his misfortune, and begged we would let him waſh his mouth with a little wine, which he had in his Bottle, which he did, but going to pour ſome into a glaſs, he perceived his wine was grown wild, being all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hairy, and rough, inſomuch that he could not drink it, either by fair means or foul. Then it was, that the old man began to deſpair indeed, but ſeeing how the company laughed at him, he was forced to be patient, and ſo to mount the Chariot, in which he camé with the two Bravoes, the Scholars and Punks. We got us into our Coach, and ſo came to <hi>Alcala,</hi> before nine in the morning: we alighted at an Inne,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115509:30"/>where we ſpent the reſt of the day, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up what we had had, which could ſo inflame our reckoning, but we could not poſſibly make it up.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>A Little before night we went out of our Inne to the houſe, which had been hired for us, being juſt without St. <hi>James</hi> Gate, the habitation of divers other Scholars. Our Land-lord was one of thoſe who did believe in Jeſus Chriſt, but onely for faſhion ſake, he was a <hi>Moriſco,</hi> ſo we call thoſe, who as I told you, are deſcended from the <hi>Moores,</hi> and though converted to the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115509:31"/>Catholique Faith, yet are ſtill preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This our Land-Lord received us with a ſowr ſcurvy look; I know not whether it were, that we ſhould at firſt uſe our ſelves to reſpect him, or that it is the cuſtom of that Nation, for indeed it is not unlikely that they who have ill faiths, have worſe looks. We hous'd our Trunks, our Beds were made, and to ſleep went we, which we did ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better then the night before. As ſoon as it was day, in came all the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of the houſe to my Maſters Chamber, and demanded their Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. He knew not what their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, but asked of me, and I who knew no more then himſelf, hid me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two quilts, for fear belike of the worſt, covered all over, except a little of my head and feet, like a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe. At laſt, they expounded their meaning, and told him, he muſt give them a Piſtol. <hi>Don-Diego</hi> preſently made his Steward give it unto them,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115509:31"/>that he might the ſooner be out of his fear, whereupon they began to make a helliſh muſick, crying, <hi>Vivat, Vivat,</hi> welcome Freſh-man. Let him hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward be admitted into our Society, and enjoy our ancient priviledges, may his skin be embroyder'd with the Itch, his clothes with rents, and his Belly, with as good an appetite as ours.</p>
                  <p>This done, they ran down ſtairs, as if the Divel, (God bleſs us) had dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them. Obſerve I pray the goodly priviledges with which they welcomed us. We roſe and went towards the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg: The Maſters preſently came and embraced <hi>Don Diego</hi> with much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for that they were well acquainted with his Father. They carried him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Chamber, where they did him all poſſible honour. Thus while I ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Stair-foot, for I did not expect ſo much kindneſs as my Maſter. I had not ſtayed there very long, before I got me into a great court, where were a great company of Scholars, who had
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115509:32"/>no ſooner eſpied me but they began to eat me with their eyes, to laugh in my face, and whiſper amongſt themſelves, but ſo that I could hear them ſay, Have at you Freſh-man; I to ſhew my ſelf good company, and that I fear'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, began to laugh as well as the beſt of them; but I could no longer forbear bluſhing, when behold one of the moſt impudent of the whole company, and who was next to me, put his hands to his noſe, ſaying, me-thinks I ſmell <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> newly raiſed from the dead, for he ſtinks cruelly; At this watch word, all the reſt took fire, and did the like, they ſtopp'd their noſes, and withdrew from me; I who ſtill endeavour'd to be thought as crafty as the beſt of them, did ſo too, ſaying, by my troth Gentlemen you are in the right, oh how it ſtinks! preſently they fell a laughing, and above a hundred of them got about me, then they began to ſneeze, fleer and make mouths, whereupon I perceived they were preparing to give me a volly of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115509:32"/>Spittle: One amongſt them, who ſeemed to be the moſt rheumatique of them all, fetch'd up a great gobbet of Phlegm out of his Stomack, ſaying, ſee what a goodly bit here is, and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al threw it at me, deſigning it for my face, but as luck would have it, it fell upon my Doublet, but ſo glewed on, that I could not poſſibly get it off. Then I began to be angry indeed. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil take me, quoth I, if I do not —and ſo ran threatning to kill him, but the ſhowr of Spittle and Snot which fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, was ſo violent, that the reſt of my words ſtuck in my teeth, for I was fain to cover my face with my cloak, and to ſtand ſtill, as the mark of their ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, with which I was ſo bedawbed, that one would have thought I had been in the Snow.</p>
                  <p>Nor was this all, one of the verieſt Rogues of the company ſeeing I kept my face whole, came to me, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be angry with the reſt, ſaid enough enough my Maſters, be quiet I pray do not kill him.</p>

                  <p>When I heard this, I was in ſome miſtruſt leaſt they would have done ſo indeed, which made me uncover my face, at which very inſtant the Rogue daſh'd a good mouthful of Phlegm juſt between my eyes, whereupon all his fellow-Raſcals began to laugh, and I to contrive how I might get away. I conſider'd in what a ſad condition I was, powder'd over with the excrements of their Stomacks, I verily imagine they never uſed ſo to purge themſelves, but when they met with ſome ſuch Freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as my ſelf, &amp; that thus they ſaved the expences of Doctors and Apothecaries. That I might be ſure of my lading, they had a great mind to beſtow ſome cuffs upon my ears, but of that there was no great likelihood, unleſs they intended to fill their hands with the Spitttle wherewith they had covered my whole body, from the crown of my head to the Sole of my foot. For that reaſon they forbore me, and did me the favour to let me go off accoutred as I was:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115509:33"/>Away I hyed me as faſt as I could to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards lam den day our lodging, and as good luck would, it was ſo early in the morning, that I only met with two or three Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Colledg, who were pure raſcals indeed, for they threw but three or four handfulls apiece of lime at me, which to my misfortune was not far off them, to perfect my painting.</p>
                  <p>Thus pickled I arrived at our lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Moriſco</hi> eſpied me, and with that began to laugh, as if he had been ready to ſplit; I thinking he intended to fill up ſome place of me, which had eſcaped, Sir ſaid I to him, pray have a care what you do, for I am not an <hi>Ecce homo:</hi> this I ſaid in reſpect of his Nation, but would to God I had been mute at that time, for he gave me two ſuch furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blows with the handle of a beſom which he then had, that he thought to have laid me on my back, whereas to ſay the truth, I ſell flat upon my face. At laſt up I got, and went to my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where I was at leaſt half an hour,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115509:34"/>pondering where I ſhould begin to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my ſelf. At laſt I had finiſhed it, and hung them out in the air, then I went to bed, and ſlept ſoundly. Not long after in came my Maſter, who finding me ſleeping, and ignorant as he was of the vile miſchance which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen me, he became very angry, and handled me, as Butchers do Piggs when they go to kill them; he pulled ſo much hair off from me, that at two handfulls more my head had been as bald as the skull of a Sceleton. I roſe up crying and weeping, my Maſters anger increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, How now Sirrah, ſaid he, is it thus that you ſerve me? doeſt thou not know me? I ſhall make you change your courſe, and lead a new life, when I heard him talk of a new life, I verily thought I had been dead in good earneſt. And well Sir quoth I, is it thus that you comfort me in my afflictions? I pray Sir do but open the door ſaid I weeping, and behold my clothes, which have this day ſerved for handkercheifs and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-Baſons,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115509:34"/>to the fouleſt noſes and loathſomeſt throats, that ever were in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogue. My Maſter ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me weep, opened the door, to ſee what ailed my clothes, which done, he began to relent, and pitty me; <hi>Buſcon</hi> ſaid he, have a good heart, cheer up thy ſelf, and though thou haſt not Father or Mother neer thee, yet be not diſmay'd. Then I recited to him, what had befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len me, He commanded me to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into another Chamber, for my better aſſiſtance, where four other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants lay. I lay me down and fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep again, and having made a good ſupper, found my ſelf in as good plight as ever: But when one misfortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls a man, it ſhould ſeem more are at hand, and that diſgraces do draw on one another. Night being come, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who lay in the chamber with me, came to bed, they bid me Good-night, and asked me how I found my ſelf? I made them a ſhort reherſal of what had betided me, at which they bleſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115509:35"/>with the ſign of the croſs, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be aſtoniſh'd at my miſchance, and as if they had no wickedneſs in them, is it poſſible, would they ſay, there ſhould be ſuch roguiſh people li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving amongſt Chriſtians? The Proctor is much too blame, for not eſtabliſhing better order in the Univerſity. Every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, there fals out ſome new diſaſter, do you know any of thoſe Rake-Hells, who have thus abuſed you? I told them not, and thanked them verv kindly for their good will. Whileſt we were thus talking, they undreſs'd themſelves, put out the Candle and went to bed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold us then in a profound Silence, and I thinking my ſelf as ſafe, as if with my own Brothers, betook me to ſleep. When about midnight I was alarumed with the noiſe of Murder, Murder, Theeves, and withal heard one laying on with a whip upon one of the beds, as hard as he could drive, up I got me in my bed, crying out where is he, what is the matter, I had hardly opened my
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115509:35"/>mouth, before I felt one lay me on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight blowes, about the waſt, all in an inſtant, with a whip of as many cords as I had backs. At this up-ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, I began to ſecond him in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, who had firſt wakened me, who continued roaring like mad, though no body felt the ſmart but my ſelf. I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out for help, and for the Juſtice, but no body ſtirr'd. The beſt remedy I found was to get me under the bed, for my ſheets and coverlet were gone; there I thought my ſelf pretty ſecure. On a ſuddain the three others began to cry: When I heard the ſalutations of the whip continue, I ſaid not a word, but thought it might be ſome body not belonging to our chamber, who was come to beſtow that morning viſit upon us. In this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, he who made the firſt out-cry, got into my bed, and dung'd it; he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his own bed, and the whip was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. All four of them roſe up, ſaying what a miſchance is this? things muſt not go thus, we will find out, who it is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115509:36"/>that hath been in our Chamber, withal they made faſt the door, pretending they had found it open. All this while I lay cloſe under the bed, grunting like a Dog, between two doors, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſtill, I got out, and asked if they had any hurt. The Divel take them quoth they, our skins are flayed. By great chance I found my bed, into which I got me the ſooneſt I could, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fell aſleep, without perceiving the bed-fellow I had gotten, my ſleep was not ſo ſound, but that I often turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from one ſide to another, inſomuch that when I awaked, I found my ſelf anointed all over, with Pilgrim-ſalve. Day being come, every one got up, but my ſelf, for I kept cloſe to conceal my trouble, and pretended the blowes of the whip made me ſick. I was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawbed with the Sir Reverence, that a Gold-finder would hardly have found in his heart to have touched me, and that which did as much perplex me, was, that I knew not how it came to paſs,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115509:36"/>unleſs the cold and fright might cauſe it. The truth is, I found my ſelf both guilty and innocent, unable either to accuſe or excuſe my ſelf. My Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions being up and ready, came about me, complaining ſome of one place, ſome of another, and diſſemblingly ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me how I felt my ſelf, very ill quoth I, for that I think I was worſe handled then all of you put together; indeed I then little thought how true I ſpoke. I asked them who they thought had done us that miſchief, I had almoſt caught him ſaid one, but he got from me, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I will find him out, though I go to a Conjurer; well patience per-force, but let us ſee, if you are ſo bad as you ſeem to be, ſure you have roared ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. Saying ſo, they made as if they would pull off the clothes, at which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, to compleat my affront, up came my Maſter, Is it poſſible <hi>Buſcon,</hi> you ſhould have ſo little care of your duty? it is at leaſt eight a clock, and you are ſtill a bed, riſe, riſe for ſhame. The
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115509:37"/>others to excuſe me unto him, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Don Diego</hi> with what had hapened; and deſired him to let me lye a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and in caſe you will not believe us, do but take up the Coverlet, and ſee in what condition he is, and withal began to move the clothes, but I held them with my hands and teeth, as faſt as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly I could for my life, that they might not ſee how I was bewray'd. When they perceived they could not have their deſign that way, do you ſmell nothing, quoth one of them? for my part me-thinks I ſmell an ill ſavour; <hi>Don Diego</hi> ſaid the like, whereupon all of them began to look about, to ſee if perchance they could find any cloſe ſtool with a Clyſter in it; In concluſion they could diſcover nothing, they ſearched the beds, and turn'd them out, to ſee if any thing were under them. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſaid one of them, this ſmell muſt needs be about <hi>Buſcon.</hi> Let us remove him, into one of our beds, and look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. I ſeeing the little likelihood
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115509:37"/>of eſcaping thoſe Devils, pretended I had a qualm upon my Stomack, I ſtared with my eyes, counterfeited the Hiccox, and made ugly faces, they who knew the meaning of it, came and held my head, whileſt <hi>Don Diego</hi> bowed my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. To be ſhort, they five lifted me out of my bed, and opening the ſheets, they thought they ſhould have dyed with laughing, when they ſaw how finely the ſheets were guilt. Alas! poor boy cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they, this he did when as he ſwound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I almoſt dead for ſhame, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited as if I had ſwounded away; bend his fingers hard ſaid they, and my Maſter thinking to do me a good office, pulled them ſo hard, that he put one of them out of joynt. After all theſe torments, there they left me. I cried for ſhame and anger both together; they told me, in a jeer, pretending though to pitty me, come the buſineſs is not much, a little water will make all clean again, better ſo then break a gut. Then they put me to bed, and away they went. When
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115509:38"/>I found my ſelf alone, I began ſeriouſly to reflect upon the hardneſs of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as alſo how I had more miſchiefs befallen me in one day at <hi>Alcala,</hi> then in all the time I had been with our before-named Doctor. I did what I could to make clean both my ſelf and my clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes; about noon I roſe, and went to wait upon my Maſter. As I paſs'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long a Gallery, the reſt of the fellow-Servants eſpied me, and after they had heartily laughed, they told me what a trick they had put upon me, which aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented my ſhame, and doubled my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Thus was I entred a free deniſon, and from that day forwards, we were all as good friends as any in the world, and I had no more miſchiefs done me.</p>

                     <hi>HAz como Vieres,</hi> ſaith the Spaniſh Proverb, do as thou ſhalt ſee cauſe; inſtructed with this noble ſentence, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to turn over a new leaf, to halt with the Cripple, and amongſt Rogues, to be as bad as the worſt of them; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether I was as good as my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, but I aſſure you, I did my weak endeavour to attain it. In the firſt place, I made ſure of all the roaſting Pigs that came within the doors, proclaiming they ſhould keep thence under penalty of life, or more properly upon pain of death: the like I did by all our Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies Pullets, which came within my Chamber. I had no ſooner made publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof, but up came two ſucking
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115509:39"/>Pigs towards our ſtair-caſe, the fatteſt and tameſt I had ever ſeen: I was then at play with the other Servants; as ſoon as I had ſpied them, I ſaid unto one of my Comerades, Prethee go ſee who's that keeps a grunting without; he did ſo, and told me, there were two little Sowes Babies; let them alone quoth I, have a care you drive them not away, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the door they are kindly welcome, and withal I ſlip'd out of the Chamber, drove them in, and laid hold on them, and puniſhed them very ſeverely for their preſumption, in coming to grunt ſo neer us. When night came, we clapp'd them upon the Spit, and my companions and my ſelf made a brave feaſt with them, and payed thoſe arrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which hunger did require at our hands. <hi>Don Diego</hi> heard of it, and was very angry with me, but all the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the houſe laughed at it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed in my behalf. <hi>Don Diego</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of me, what I would do if the Juſtice ſhould ſeize on me? I told him I would
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115509:39"/>appeal from him unto Famine, the <hi>Aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> of all Scholars, and in caſe he would not admit of my plea, I ſaid I would tell him, they came into our Chamber, without ever knocking at the door, which made me believe they did belong to us; they all fell a laughing at my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. By my troth <hi>Buſcon,</hi> quoth my Maſter, you begin to be a right Rake-Hell indeed, if thou doeſt but proceed, thou wilt in a little time commence Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Arts; it is worth your obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to conſider how modeſt and religious a Gentleman my Maſter was; and how ſubtle &amp; crafty a knave his man was; for the truth is, we were of two contrary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, he loved vertue, and I rogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, better then my meat. Our Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady was glad at the heart to ſee my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, for we had made an agreement together, and conſpired againſt our Steward; whereupon I was made Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, and from that hour, I took a great delight to be of <hi>Judas</hi> his Trade, and to bring in round reckonings. The
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115509:40"/>Eleſh which our Miſtreſs brought in the houſe, did never hold out, according to the true rules of Proportion, but kept ſtill in Abatement. If there was any beef or goat to be had, ſhe never bought Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, inſomuch that we had alwayes Phiſick Broth, ſo lean and tranſparent, that had it been frozen, you would have ſworn it had been Chryſtal; ſometimes indeed to keep us in heart, ſhe put a candles end or two into the pot. When ever ſhe ſaw me before my Maſter, ſhe would be telling him, <hi>Buſcon</hi> was the beſt Servant ſhe ever yet knew, but that he was ſomewhat knaviſh, however I adviſe you, would ſhe ſay, not to part with him, for in conſideration of his great truſtineſs, you may wink at his ſmaller pranks. The like I did by her, as occaſion ſerved, and in this manner we cheated the whole houſe.</p>
                  <p>When there was any Candles, Salt, Peaſe or Bacon to be bought, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes kept at leaſt half of it for our own uſe, which we ſold-unto my Maſter,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115509:40"/>when he next wanted any. That we might appear good Servants indeed, we did often tell him, he was too too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, that his expences were too great, and that a Kings Exchequer would hardly maintain him. If I bought any thing, and told my Maſter the truth of what I paid for it, preſently in came our Land-lady, and making as if we had no intelligence with one another, how now <hi>Buſcon</hi> would ſhe ſay, do you think to make me believe, that this coſt you twelve pence? then I pretended to ſtep aſide and weep, afterwards I would go to my Maſter, and complain of the ill offices ſome endeavour'd to do me, and would preſs him to ſend his Steward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the market, to be inform'd of the truth, that I might thereby ſtop our Land-ladies mouth, who was ever prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. He would then ſend him, who returning, ſatisfied my Maſter with the truth: by this means <hi>Don Diego</hi> and his Steward were very well inform'd of my honeſty, and not diſpleaſed with our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115509:41"/>Miſtreſſes good will, and then would my Maſter ſay unto his Steward, would to God <hi>Buſcon</hi> were as free from vice, as he is full of honeſty. By theſe devices did we ſuck his blood like Horſe-leech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but much better. Perchance gentle Reader, you will tell me that our booty at the years end might be conſiderable, and that I was in conſcience bound to make reſtitution; the one I confeſs, the t'other I utterly deny, for that our Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady confeſſed and received the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion every eight dayes, and yet I could never hear or perceive, ſhe had the leaſt intention of reſtoring, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that ſhe made any ſcruple of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that imitating ſuch a godly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Saint as ſhe was, I thought I had done no fault at all: ſhe did ware about her neck a pair of Beads ſo heavy, that one leſs devout then ſhe, would as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have carried the Morters. There hung upon it, ſeveral mettals, Images, Croſſes, Pictures, and indulgences, with which, to uſe her own terms, ſhe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115509:41"/>prayed for her benefactors: She had above a hundred Saints, who were her Advocates; and the truth is, ſhe had need of ſo many more interceſſors, to procure remiſſion of the ſins ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. She lay in a Chamber over my Maſters, and ſaid more Prayers then the ableſt of the three hundred blind Beggers of <hi>Paris;</hi> in which ſhe uſed ſuch latine words as <hi>Cicero</hi> never knew, ſo that we would almoſt kill our ſelves with laughing: She had beſides theſe, many other good qualities; ſhe was a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler of ſuch as differ in affections; a Doctreſs of delight, which is as much as to ſay, a Baud. If at any time I fell out with her, ſhe would excuſe her ſelf, ſaying, it is an ill bird which defiles his own neſt.</p>
                  <p>Gentle Reader, I would not have thee believe that we were always good friends no, no, you muſt know, it is impoſſible for two covetous friends, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually gaping after their particular profit, to hold good correſpondence
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115509:42"/>any long time together; for they will be endeavouring how to deceive one the other, and for my own particular, I muſt needs confeſs, I ſhould do ſo, if I found any handſome oportunity, as I am now going to let you ſee.</p>
                  <p>She bred up in a back-court of the Houſe, good ſtore of Poultry; I once caſt mine eyes on them, and began to long like a woman with child, for to ſee a couple of the beſt Chicken there, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy roſted in a diſh: It chanced upon a day that ſhe went to feed them, and there cried <hi>Pio, pio, pio,</hi> which ſhe did ſeveral times together: I preſently fancied what that might allude unto; in order to my ſatisfaction: Oh God! Miſtreſs <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> (for ſuch was her name) would to Chriſt you had either killed a man, or clipp'd money, rather then done that thing, for I muſt of neceſſity go and accuſe you: Oh how unfortunate are we both, that it ſhould thus fall out! She was not a little troubled ſeeing me make ſuch complaints; well, what is it I have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115509:42"/>done, ſaid ſhe, prethee dear <hi>Buſcon,</hi> tell me whether thou art in jeſt or in earneſt, and rid me of the fright in which thou haſt put me: How, quoth I, whether I am in jeſt, would to God it were no worſe: I muſt go and acquaint the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition with it, elſe I am excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, <hi>ipſo facto:</hi> To the Inquiſition, ſaid ſhe; why have I committed ought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Catholique Faith? Nay it is worſe, ſaid I, do not mock at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors, but confeſs your blaſphemy, acknowledge your own wickedneſs, and recant what you have ſaid: If I ſhould recant it, quoth ſhe, pale and trembling as ſhe was, would they condemn me to undergo any corporal publique puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? no, ſaid I, they would then abſolve you; then I eat my words, ſaid ſhee, but you muſt then tell me what I ſaid, for I know not: Is it poſſible you ſhould be ſo ignorant, replied I, I can-well tell how to expreſs it unto you, for the hainouſneſs of the offence is ſo great, that I ſhake for very fear, at the thought
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115509:43"/>of it. Do you not remember that when you called your Chickens, you cried, <hi>Pio, pio, pio,</hi> and that <hi>Pio</hi> is the name of the Popes, who are Gods Vicegerents, and the Keys of the Church: She was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dead with grief. It is true <hi>Buſcon,</hi> I ſaid ſo indeed; but if I ſaid it out of any ill will, I wiſh I might never go more. Prethee try if thou canſt not find out ſome invention to avoid accuſing of me; for I had rather be hanged then go before the Inquiſition. I told her, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſhe would ſwear upon the Holy Altar, that ſhe ſaid it not out of malice; I were then diſpenced withal for accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her; but then of neceſſity, thoſe very two Chickens which firſt came to eat (I obſerved them both very well) when you ſaid thoſe bleſſed names of the High Biſhops, muſt be delivered into my hands, that I may carry them to a Familiar, for ſo one of the Miniſters of the Inquiſition is called, that he may burn them, for they are accurſed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, you muſt ſolemnly vow, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115509:43"/>to fall again into the like horrible blaſphemy: She was overjoyed to hear this expedient; <hi>Buſcon,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee take thoſe two Chickens immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and let them ſuffer for my ſin, and too morrow I will make my ſolemn vow before the Alter. I told her, there was yet one inconvenience unprevented, for ſaid I, the Familiar will ask of me, if I were the perſon who had committed this great crime, and in this uncertainty he might do me a miſchief; wherefore I am of opinion, continued I, that you your ſelf go; for I muſt needs confeſs, I do not deſire to have to do with thoſe kind of people, for they ſpare no man. Alaſs! dear <hi>Buſcon,</hi> ſaid ſhe, hearing me ſay ſo, for Gods ſake pity me, and carry them, I hope you will not be in any danger; and I aſſure thee thou wilt rid me of a great vexation. I made her begg me a good while, before I would yeild unto her: in fine, I condeſcended, and away I went with the two Chickens, which I conveyed into my Chamber:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115509:44"/>I pretended to go about it, and at laſt home I came, and told her all things had ſucceeded better then I expected; The Familiar indeed, ſaid I, was once in the mind to come along with me, to ſee the woman who had done the fact, but I put him off with much ado, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe hugg'd me, and gave me ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chick for my pains, which with its other two companions, were eaten that night by my ſelf, and the reſt of the ſervants of the Houſe: Not long after, <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſmelt out the trick I had put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, whereat ſhe was like to burſt for ſpite, nay ſhe wanted but little of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering my tricks to my Maſter, but ſhe being party to the crime, feared leſt ſhe might become partaker of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Behold me now at open defiance with Madam <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and without hopes of reconcilement, whereupon I was forced to ſeek out new inventions to paſs away the time, for I could not forbear my Rogueries, which I had learn'd amongſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115509:44"/>the Scholars. One night I walked a broad into the Town, about nine at night, at which time, there are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people in the Streets.</p>
                  <p>I paſs'd cloſe by a Drugiſters ſhop, and perceiv'd a frayl of Raiſins lying on the ſtall, I ſeized on them, and ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with all my force; the Apprentices of the ſhop, together with the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, began to run after me as hard as they could drive. I was the better Foot-man, and had gotten a good way before them; but the waight I carried, hindred me ſo much, that they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me, had it not been for a Stratagem which came into my head, which was this, turning at the corner of a Street, I made a ſhort ſtop, and getting upon a Stall, began to cry, holding one of my legs in my hand, The Devil take you rogue, he hath lamed me, juſt as they were paſſing by, Where is he? where is he? ſaid they all out of breath. Yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſaid I goes a boy, the Devil go with him, I think he hath broken my leg, the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115509:45"/>Devil break his neck. I know not whether it be he you look for.</p>
                  <p>Away they went down the Street, and I went my wayes with the Frail: home I came, and told my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons what had paſs'd, but they would not believe it; to convince them, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them out the next night to ſee me run, not at the Ring, but at the Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers box; whom I had ſo newly met with. The hour being come, I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Frails were not now on the ſtall, but within the Shop, and that I could not reach them with my hands, beſides the Grocer himſelf was there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his guard, having been ſo lately bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, however I would not relinquiſh my deſign. I got me on the other ſide of the Street, juſt over againſt the ſhop; with my ſword in my hand; which was a good ſtiff tuck; then I began to run directly into the ſhop, as hard as I could, and crying kill him, kill him, I made a full thruſt, which miſs'd little of Maſter Grocers beard, but entred into
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115509:45"/>one of the Boxes; the Maſter of the Shop fell down under his Counting-board as if he had been killed indeed, though he was not ſo much as touch'd; and I in the mean while carried away the the Box upon the point of my Sword. Thus I made my companions ſee, that I wanted neither wit nor courage to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any good deſigne, and they themſelves confeſſed, that I alone was able to maintain the whole Houſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided I could but ſee enough to take, which in plain Engliſh was as much as to ſay, I was a good Thief. I was young and very proud of being ſo commended; whereupon I gave up my ſelf to ſtudie what Prank I ſhould play next.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe I perceived <hi>Don Diego</hi> did not miſlike it, ſeeing I came clever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly off, I laid a wager with him one day, I would get all the Swords of the Round which was duely made every night in <hi>Alcala.</hi> To ſee the effect of it, we all got out of the houſe one night, and went to a certain place, where we knew the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115509:46"/>Round muſt paſs of neceſſity: When we perceived them coming, I march'd up before the reſt of the ſervants, and began to cry out in a pitiful tone, Juſtice, Juſtice: Who's there, ſaid they? Is the Captain there, quoth I? Yes ſaid they, thereupon I fell on my knees: Sir ſaid I, I demand Juſtice of you, it lies in your power to do me right in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage which was committed againſt me; and withal, do the Common-wealth good ſervice: I beſeech you Sir hear me but two words in private, I ſhall acquaint you with a brave diſcovery: Preſently he withdrew from the reſt of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and came to me: In the mean time the watchmen began to look about, and to ſee whether their Swords were cleer, and their Piſtols in good order: I have followed ſix men from <hi>Sevil</hi> hither, the wickedſt Rogues that ever lived; in a word, they are both Theeves and Murderers, one of them kill'd my Mother, and a little Brother that I had, having broken into our houſe to rob us:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115509:46"/>there are witneſſes enough of it; and it is ſaid that they came to guard a certain French Spie, whom I ſuppoſe to be <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio Peres,</hi> ſpeaking very ſoftly. I had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but he opened his ears; Where are they? In the Colledge, ſaid I; I conjure you to uſe the utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the fouls of my Mother and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will reward you with their Prayers, and the King with temporal benefits: Patience, replyed he, we will loſe no more time; follow me, quoth he, to his Archers, and give me my Target: No no, Sir ſaid I, taking him aſide, you will undoe all, and endanger your ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if you go that way to work; you had better go in one by one, and without Swords, for they have all of them Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols; and in caſe they perceive you with the Arms, they will ſuſpect you, ſeeing none but Officers dares wear a Sword in this place, and then doubtleſs they would fire upon you: Your beſt way is to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry your Daggers cloſe under your Cloaks, and then we ſhal be ſure of them,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115509:47"/>for we are enough of us. The <hi>Corrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> approved of my advice; by this we were come unto the place, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his followers to hide their Swords in the graſs, which was juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Houſe, which they all did, and ſo went on; They all entred in, my ſelf being the laſt man: Now I had pre-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed my Companion, that aſſoon as they ſhould lay down their Swords, he ſhould ſeize on them, and away, which he did very dexterouſly: They all march'd in, and my ſelf in the rear of them; but without more adoe, I hy'd me into my Chamber with my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: In the interim, behold the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigidore</hi> with his Archers, who finding nothing in the Houſe but Scholars, went out to look for me, he perceiving me va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, began to conceive how he was gull'd. Out he goes with all his men, whom he ſent for their Swords; but with all their diligence, they could not find ſo much as half of one. It were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to acquaint you with the many
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115509:47"/>ſearches and re-ſearches, which the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigidore</hi> and <hi>Rector</hi> of the Colledg made that very night: I ſhall therefore only tell you how they ſought up and down every Court and corner of the Houſe; all the Chambers, nay, the very Beds: Now I for fear of being diſcovered, got me to bed, with a night Cap on my head, a wax Candle in one hand, and a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix in t'other, and a young Prieſt at my beds-head, inſtructing and aſſiſting me to dye; all the reſt of my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were at their Letanies; when behold up came the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Corrigidore,</hi> who ſeeing ſo ſad a ſpectacle, preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, thinking I had little need of ſo many Swords to defend me from death; but on the contrary, they ſaid certain Prayers in my behalf, and went away without the leaſt hopes of recovering their Swords. The <hi>Rector</hi> vowed unto the <hi>Corrigidore,</hi> to deliver into his hands him who had done this affront; and the other ſwore he would hang him, though he were a Dukes Son: Day came, I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115509:48"/>again and made my ſelf ready. In <hi>Alcala</hi> they talk of this adventure to this very day; All the people, the Porters, Barbers, Coſter-mongers, and reverend Hearb-women, (for I ſhall never forget them, with th'pox to them, ſince they affronted me when I was King of the Scholars) entertain themſelves with the diſcourſe of it upon the high-way: I ſhall not acquaint you with the Tributes I took of green Peaſe and Beans, upon Raiſins and Herbs, of our neighbours Gardens, which lay near our lodging: By theſe and the like devices I acquired the reputation of being the archeſt Crack in all the Country; for which I was ſo beloved by all the Gentry, that I had much ado to ſtay with <hi>Don Diego,</hi> whom I ever reſpected for the affection he bore unto me.</p>

                        <p>THE great employments which I have under his Majeſty, have hindred me from writing unto you any ſooner: I muſt confeſs it a troubleſome buſineſs to be in his Majeſties ſervice; yet the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory we take in that Title, doth a little mollifie the trouble thereof. I am much afflicted to be the conveyancer of ſuch newes unto you as cannot be very welcome: Your Father dyed eight dayes ſince; but the moſt generouſly that I ever yet ſaw man. I muſt needs give that teſtimony of him in all places, for it was my ſelf who truſs'd him up: He march'd along looking up to the Windows, and making Civilities to all ſuch as had neglected their other affairs to behold him: He came unto the Pillar of wood, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the <hi>Gibbet,</hi> The <hi>Non plus ultra</hi> of his life: He got to the Ladder, which he mounted up with a good grace, and being a lover of order, having ſpied one of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115509:49"/>the Rounds of the Ladder broken, over which he got, he turned about to the Juſtice, and deſired it might be mended for the next commer, who perhaps might be leſs active then himſelf. I cannot well repreſent unto you, how handſomely he appeared in the eyes of all the Spectators; He ſate him down in a moſt becoming poſture; he took the Cord himſelf, and faſtned the knot of it; and ſeeing the <hi>Fryer,</hi> who aſsiſted him, began to exhort him unto conſtancy: Father, quoth he, I have long ſince prepared my ſelf for this action; Let us only ſay a little of the <hi>Belief,</hi> and ſo make an end, for I would not be troubleſome to the company; which doné, he threw off himſelf, without folding of his legs, or making any ugly faces, and ſo he continued a pretty while, with a moſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable gravity. I quarterd him, and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the high-ways. God knows how I was troubled to ſee him in that condition, when he was cut out into Crows meat; but I hope the <hi>Pie-makers</hi> of the Country will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to lodge him in a better place. As for your Mother though yet living, I can ſay lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115509:50"/>better, for ſhe is in the hand of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of <hi>Toledo,</hi> accuſed of unburying the dead, (notwithſtanding ſhe never ſpoke ill of any one) as alſo of killing labourers Cattel: The truth is, there were found about her, more Heads, Legs, Arms, of wax, then are in a Chappel of miracles: In a word, 'tis thought ſhe is a Jew and a Witch. I am exceedingly afflicted that ſhe ſhould ſo diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour our Family, in which I have no ſmall intereſt, being an Officer of the Kings; for the relation I have unto her, is no mean diſcredit to me amongſt perſons of quality: Beſides, my dear child, I have ſomething which belongs to you; as Heir to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, in all about four hundred Duckets: Moreover, I am your Uncle, I have not any children, but ſhall reſign mine Office unto you: You may therefore on ſight hereof, provide to come hither; for with that Latine and Rhetorique which you know, I perſwade my ſelf you will be a very dexterous Proficient in our Trade.

                     <hi>I muſt needs confeſs, I was much out of countenance at the ſhame and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of my Parents, but I was quickly comforted, when I conſidered of the money. I went unto</hi> Don Diego. <hi>whom I found ſtill reading of his Letters; in which his Father commanded him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto</hi> Segovia, <hi>and to leave me at</hi> Alcala, <hi>for he had heard ſome of my Pranks. He told me, his Father had commanded him thence, and that he was ſorry to leave me; but withal, that he would recommend me in caſe I liked it, unto a Gentleman, a friend of his, to be his ſervant: Sir, ſaid I to him, I have my thoughts a little higher then ſo; I renounce the meaneſs of all thoſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I intend to ſcale Honour; and if hitherto I have had one foot upon the Ladder, as every one knows: You may be pleaſed to underſtand, That my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath mounted up to the very top of it.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115509:51"/>he knowing who I was, I might the more freely, and with leſs ſhame, diſcover the whole affair unto him: He was very ſad at it, and ask'd me what I intended to do.

                  <p>AT length the day came that I was to abandon the moſt pleaſant life I had yet known: God knows what a regret it was unto me, to bid adieu unto ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friends and companions. I ſold thoſe few things I had, amongſt my fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and by the help of ſome certain devices of mine, I pickt up about ſix hundred Ryals: I bought me a Mule,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115509:52"/>and got out of the houſe, having little beſides my ſhadow to carry with me. I cannot expreſs unto you in what lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations I left the poor Cobler, for the ſhoes where with he had truſted me, nor the ſadneſs of Dame <hi>Cyprian</hi> our Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, for the monies ſhe had lent me, nor the clamours of her husband for the hire of our Lodgings; for to ſay the truth, I carried away the money my Maſter had left with me to pay him; one ſaid his heart did alwayes miſ-give him; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that he ever thought me a rogue. But ſo it was, I went away ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, that at leaſt half of thoſe who knew me, wept for my departure, and t'other half laughed at thoſe who wept. In the vvay, I entertained my ſelf vvith thinking on thoſe affairs, vvhen having paſs'd <hi>Torote,</hi> I overtook a man upon a little mule, talking to himſelf, and ſo much given over to his frenzy, that though I vvas come up cloſe by his ſide, yet he ſavv me not; I rouzed him out of his extaſie, by ſaluting him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115509:52"/>my civility, I asked him vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he vvent, and being each of us ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in our demands of that nature, he began to queſtion me, concerning the <hi>Turks</hi> coming into Chriſtendom, and of vvhat forces the King had to oppoſe him.</p>
                  <p>Then he asked me vvhat means there vvere to regain the holy Land, and hovv <hi>Argiere</hi> might be taken; by this I ſmelt him to be a fool of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvealth.</p>
                  <p>We continued our diſcourſe, and from one thing to another, we came at laſt into <hi>Flanders,</hi> that is, to talk of thoſe Countries. There it was that he began to look about him indeed, Thoſe States quoth he, ſtand me in more then the King himſelf; for it is fourteen years ſince I fell upon a deſign, which but that it is impoſſible, had produced a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral peace. Wherein I pray, ſaid I, doth conſiſt the convenience and alſo impoſſibility together, that it cannot be effected? what is it that you ſay,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115509:53"/>replied he? that it cannot be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Yes, it may be effected, but to be impoſſible is quite another thing, and were it not for fear of troubling your patience, I would acquaint you with it, for I am now upon printing of it, with ſome few other works of mine, wherein I will ſhew his Majeſty how to take <hi>Oaſtend</hi> two ſeveral ways. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched him to make me acquainted with it, whereupon he fell a groping in his pockets, and at laſt drew out a map, both of the enemies and our Fort, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you ſee all the difficulty of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs conſiſteth in this arm of the Sea there, now I ſhall furniſh you with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to dry it quite up, which may be done with Sponges. I no ſooner heard that word, but a fit of laughter came into my mouth, and he inſtead of being any way offended there with, began to laugh in like manner, 'tis true, ſaid he, all men unto whom I have diſcoverd this my invention, have done the ſame, as you do, ſo well pleaſed they were with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115509:53"/>it. I believe ſo ſaid I, they could do no leſs, hearing ſuch a new invention, and founded upon ſuch ſolid reaſons, yet I muſt needs tell you, under favour, that having drain'd up all the water in it, yet would the Sea quickly fill it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; Oh I have a device for that too, replied he, for I would have the Sea there undermined about a dozen Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, I durſt not ſay one word more to him, for fear leſt he ſhould tell me of a device to pull Heaven down upon earth, for in good earneſt, I never met with ſuch extravagant follies; with theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable propoſals we came unto <hi>Torre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,</hi> where my Engineer ſtayed, for he was to viſit a kinſman of his: I rode on, laughing at the conceit of his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. That day fortune was very favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to me indeed, much more then uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by her care of entertaining me; for ſhe brought me to ſee a mule bridled and ſadled, a good way from me, feeding at full liberty, and not far thence a man looking on a book, and drawing lines
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115509:54"/>therein with a pen, which he meaſured with a pair of Compaſſes. Then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him retreating and advancing, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out his arms, as if he were fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ever now and then his arms would be croſs'd one over t'other, in a thouſand ſeveral poſtures, as if he were at Sword and Dagger. Never was man ſo aſtoniſhed as my ſelf at the ſight hereof: To be ſhort, I concluded it was ſome Conjurer, God bleſs us, in which apprehenſion, I durſt hardly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to go any farther, However I took heart at grace, and on I march'd; at laſt he ſpied me, and with that ſhut up his book, and clapping his foot in the Stirrop, by accident he ſlipt out again, and fell all along upon the ground. I went to him, and help'd him up again, and he looking ſomewhat ſcurvily upon me, ſaid, I did not take the due center of my circumference in mounting. I underſtood not what he ſaid, but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him to be the moſt abſolure fool, that ever yet frighted woman. He ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115509:54"/>me whether I were travelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Madrid</hi> in a direct or circumflex Line? He demanded what manner of Sword it was I wore by my ſide, and whoſe it was? I told him it was my own; Thoſe croſs barrs of your Hilt ſhould have been longer, to have defended the down right blows which are formed in the Center of the Stocadoes, ſaid he. When I heard him canting in ſuch ſtrange and hideous terms, I took the boldneſs to ask him, of what profeſſion he was? he anſwered me that he was a moſt accompliſhed Maſter of defence, <hi>viz,</hi> a Fencer, and that he would make tryal of his skill, in any place whatever, at ſingle Rapier, or at Sword &amp; Dagger; I believe it, I believe it, ſaid I in a great deal of haſt, for fear leſt he ſhould have challenged me. To tel you the truth, ſaid I, I took you rather for ſome Conjurer, then a Fencer, before I came up to you. I was, replied he, endeavouring to find out an <hi>Idea</hi> which then came into my mind, wherewith by means of the fourth
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115509:55"/>Circle and Rule of Proportion, I might ingage any man's Sword living, in a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and ſo kill him, with a confeſſion that he might never be able to diſcover who did it, and when you were juſt come to me, I was trying it by the rules of the Mathematiques. Why ſaid I is it poſſible there ſhould be any Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal rules in it? do you doubt it quoth he, nay, there is not only the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, but alſo <hi>Divinity, Philoſophy, Muſick, and Phyſick;</hi> as for the laſt I doubt it not, ſaid I, for that treats of killing; do not laugh at it replied he, for I will inſtantly teach you a notable thruſt againſt a down-right blow, which ſhall comprehend in it, all the ſpiral lines of the Sword. For my part ſaid I, I underſtand not one ſyllable of what you ſpeak, neither little nor great. Hold ſaid he, there's a book which expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all of them, it is called the <hi>Swords Dexterity,</hi> It is an excellent good one, and containes miracles, and that you may no longer doubt it, when we come
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115509:55"/>to <hi>Rejas,</hi> whither we are going, you ſhall ſee me do wonders with a couple of Spits; therefore I pray believe, he who reads this book may eaſily kill, whom he will, and as many as he will. He had need then replied I, get a receipt how to make the Plague, or turn Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Phyſick. Whileſt we were thus diſcourſing, we came to <hi>Rejas,</hi> and as we were alighting at the Stable, he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to me, that I ſhould make an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe angle with my leggs, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them into paralell lines, that I ſhould alight perpendicularly. The Hoſt, who was at the door, ſeeing me laugh, did the like, and asked me if the Gentleman were a <hi>Jew</hi> or an <hi>Hebrew?</hi> With that queſtion I thought I ſhould have dyed. Well, he put his Mule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Stable, and then ſpake to the hoſt ſaying, Ho lo, you within there, pray lend me a couple of ſpits, that I may roaſt two or three Angles, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them immediately; Yes Sir ſaid the Maſter of the houſe, but you need
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115509:56"/>not put your ſelf to the trouble Sir, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give me the Angles, my wife ſhall dreſs them, though I muſt confeſs I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet heard of any ſuch Birds. How? they are not birds ſaid the Fencer, and looking upon me, began to ſmile, to ſee what ignorance is, lend me two Broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, I mean only to fence a little, and peradventure what I ſhall ſhew you, may be worth you more then all you ever got in your life. To be ſhort, the ſpits were all uſed, and inſtead of them he was forced to be contented with two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels: never was there ſeen a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſpectacle; he ſtood upon his guard, in this poſture quoth he, I advance, and I make my thruſt, and gain the point of the eye: Remember it, for I make uſe of it, at this day to kill to the life.</p>

He had ſcarce made an end of ſpeaking, but I ſpied coming out of a Chamber over againſt us, a certain Perſonage, who ſeemed to be ſomewhat diſcontented, his Muſtachio's of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and as big as the mane of a bay-horſe well made, a broad brim'd hat, with one ſide buttoned up, the t'other hanging over his face, a kind of a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, made of an old Table cloth, juſt like an Ox-coller, his legs diſplayed like the Emperial Eagles, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with a great <hi>Per Signum Crucis de Inimicis ſuis.</hi> His Muſtachio's like a pair of Spindles, a Sword by his ſide, a Dagger upon his Kidneys, with the bars ſhining like a Nuns Parlour, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115509:57"/>looking on the ground, I have been ſaid he in my dayes— as theſe marks will teſtifie, and by my head, I will give him a hundred cuts with my Sword, nay Il'e kill him outright, that ſhall dare to injure the Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-Maſters; with that he laid his hand on his hilts, and withdrew three paces backwards. I was afraid of a quarrel, to prevent which I ſtep'd in between them, and told him there was no body ſpake to him, nor gave him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny provocation: However he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his fury, let him come cryed he, with his naked Sword, if he hath ever a one, and leave his Ladles, that we may ſhew wherein lies the true ſecret of arms, Therewithal my poor Companion took out his book, and ſaid, look you here's the Book which containeth it, it is print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Kings Priviledg, and I will maintain the truth of it with this Ladle here, and in all places whatever; for look you, let us meaſure, and then drawing his compaſs, this Angle is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115509:57"/>but the 'tother drawing his Sword, I know neither <hi>Angel</hi> nor <hi>Obtuſe,</hi> nor did I ever hear of any ſuch Fencers names; but with this Sword in my hand, I'le cut off all their heads that ſhall deſpiſe our Art; therewithal he held up his hand to ſtrike, but the poor Rogue my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, at the ſame time began to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him; and run away towards our Chamber. It is our of his power to hurt me, cryed he, for I have gotten the height of his eye: with much ado, at laſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the houſe, an my ſelf made them friends; for my own part, I could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak for laughing. We lay in the ſame Chamber, we went to ſupper, and ſo to bed: About two in the morning he roſe up in his ſhirt, and began to grope about the Chamber, advancing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating, withal uttering a thouſand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances in Mathematical Language; he wakened me, and not only ſo, but called for the Chamberlain to bring him a Candle, ſaying, he had found the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject fixed to the Stoccade; our Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115509:58"/>curſed him to the pit of Hell for troubling of him, and at laſt called him fool; with that he return'd back to his Chamber, and told me, if I would riſe, I ſhould ſee what a rare invention he had found againſt Turkiſh Cimiters, which he was then going to make his Majeſty acquainted withal, for that it greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the welfare of Chriſtendome. Not long after the day began to appear, we roſe, my Companion and the Fencing Maſter ſhook hands, and I payed our Reckoning, and ſo we proceeded on our Journey.</p>

                  <p>I Took my way towards <hi>Madrid,</hi> and my Companion parted with me, for he was bound another way: He had no ſooner left me, but he cried out to me aloud; I ſtayd for him, and though we were in the open field, and no body near us, yet he came to me, and whiſper'd me in the ear, ſaying; For Gods ſake Sir, let me beg you not to diſcover unto any man, thoſe rare Myſteries which I have ſhewed unto you, but make uſe of them for your own occaſions, I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him ſo to do: He went his way, and I mine, laughing at the conceit of his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115509:59"/>Extravagances. Thus I rod on above a League without meeting any one, rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating with my ſelf upon ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which preſented themſelves to my thoughts, concerning my profeſſion of Honour and Vertue; for firſt I was of neceſſity to obliterate the memory of my Father, and then to lead ſuch a life as might ſerve to conceal my ſelf. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thoſe very propoſals to be a good beginning, and ſaid in my mind; Could I but once, of my ſelf, produce ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as might ſavour of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> I ſhould be a thouſand times more to be commended then thoſe who derive them from their Grand-Father. Theſe were my contemplations, when behold I overtook an old man on a Mule, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king towards <hi>Madrid.</hi> After uſual ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations we fell into diſcourſe; he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of me whence I came: I told him from <hi>Alcala:</hi> A curſe light upon thoſe Countries, replied he, for there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one man of underſtanding therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts: I wonder ſaid I, you ſhould ſo
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115509:59"/>undervalue them, for I aſſure you, there are many ingenuous men in thoſe parts. Ingenuous men ſay you, (replied he all in a fury) whereabouts I pray you? I am ſure I lived fourteen years ſince at <hi>Majabond,</hi> where I was a School-maſter and the man that made all the <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Carols they ſung there, yet they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much wit as to make me any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for it; but that you may be made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible both of their ingratitude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, I ſhall ſhew you a Song, which is here in my Satchel; with that he put his hands into his Breeches, I obſerved his action, and could not but much wonder at his behaviour: After he had fumbled up and down on both ſides, a pretty while together, he drew me out a certain Fardle of papers, as greaſie as a Cooks clothes; amongſt them he pick'd out one, in which was deſcribed the meeting of the Shepheards going to <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> made up in as pittiful ſad Rhimes as ever was ſeen in a Ballad. It was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible for me to ſay any thing in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115509:60"/>againſt him; for I gave up my ſelf to ſuch a fit of laughter at the ſight of his ſimplicity, that I could ſcarce fetch my breath.</p>
                  <p>So I began to flatter him, for my better paſtime, and told him I was much of his opinion concerning the beaſtiality and ſtupidity of thoſe people, who were unable to judge of things according to their worth; and that for my own part, I had never ſeen any thing in my life, which pleaſed me better. I beſeech you ſaid he, ſince you like them ſo well, to hear a little piece of a Book I have made upon the eleven thouſand Virgins; upon each of which I have made fifty Stanzas of eight Verſes a piece: I aſſure you it's a rich piece: I to excuſe my ſelf from hearing ſo many Millions of Stanzas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched him to talk to me no more of godly affairs: I think the Devil is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to vex me with this importunate Raſcal, ſaid I to my ſelf, turning about my head, and making a ſowr face: He without more ado, fell a groping for a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115509:60"/>Comedy, in which were more days work then a man had need to have made in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> I did it in two days, ſaid he, this is but the foul draught; it will take up at leaſt half a Ream of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per when it is compleated; I have named it <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark: All the Repreſentations are of Cocks, Birds, Foxes, Aſſes, and Boars, in imitation of <hi>Aeſops</hi> Fables. It is my own, added he, and in deed I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the world never yet ſaw the like; if I could but once get it acted, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident all the Spectators would be raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Well, ſaid I, but how can that be, when all the <hi>Interlocutors</hi> muſt be beaſts, which cannot ſpeak; Ah th'Devil on't, that's all the difficulty in it; but I have a trick for that too: I can change my fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and put in Parrots, Jayes, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, &amp; Starlings, all which may be taught to ſpeak: and for the Interludes, I will bring in Apes, Monkies, and the like: Yes marry, ſaid I, now I hold with you, now you have hit the nayl on the head. This is not all, replyed he, I have ſome
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115509:61"/>other fine toyes, which I made upon a woman whom I loved: Look you, ſaid he, here are nine hundred and one Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and twelve Copies of Verſes, (when I heard him naming thoſe numbers, I verily thought he had been talking of money) all which I made upon her feet. I asked him if ever he had ſeen her feet, not as yet replied he, but the conceipts are by way of Propheſie. I was much pleaſed with the mans ingenuity; but the fear I was in, leaſt he ſhould begin to read ſome of his <hi>Iliads,</hi> made me alter my diſcourſe. Looking about, I ſpied a Hare, which I ſhewed to him; in good time, ſaid he, for in one of my Sonnets I have compared her to that creature; and withal he began to recite it, and I to divert him, told him, look yonder is the Star which uſhers in the day. Every thing falls out to day according to my wiſh, ſaid he, I will now, ending his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, recite you the thirtieth, in which I compare her to a Star; when I heard that, I began to diſpair, fearing there
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115509:61"/>was not any thing on earth, or in Heaven, upon which, he had not made ſome Rhimes. But when I found we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> I was in hopes he would not have rehearſed his ſtuff in the ſtreets; but to my great affliction, it fell out quite contrary, for to ſhew what he was he ſpake ſo much the louder. I begg'd him to be quiet, telling him, that ſhould the children hear he was a Poet, they would throw Lime, and rotten Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples at us, becauſe of late they had been declared to be all fools, by the <hi>Politique Ordinances,</hi> Publiſhed againſt them, by a certain perſon, who had once been of the Poetique Sect, but ſince reclaimed, and brought to his right wits. He was ſtark mad to hear me ſay ſo, but howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intreated me to let him ſee them, if I had them. I told him I would, when we were at our Lodging. Now becauſe he was acquainted in the Town, and I not, I was guided by him. We went then to an Inn where he uſed to lodge: At the door we found about a dozen
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115509:62"/>Fidlers and blind Raſcals, who were waiting for him: After mutual embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they asked him for ſome freſh Carols, new Songs, Lampoons, or any other pieces of wit: He drew them out a good many, from a Wallet which he had, and got five Ryals a piece for his Papers. In fine, he bid them farewel, and turning to me, look you, ſaid he, I will get above three hundred Ryals of thoſe people before I go hence; and therefore that I may diſpatch their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, I muſt needs beg leave to retire from you a little while, and after ſupper we will ſee thoſe accurſed Ordinances, of which you told me.</p>

                     <hi>ALthough</hi> we are duely inform'd that there is a certain kind of Vermin, called Poets, who are totally addicted to Idolatry, worſhiping Hairs, Teeth, Gloves, Shoo-ſtrings, and the like; as alſo who daily commit infinite other ſins much more hainous, as if they were Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians or Pagans: yet are we neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs deſireous of their converſion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to uſe them charitably, in regard they are Chriſtians, and our neighbours. We do therefore Ordain, That in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Week, they be aſſembled together in ſome publique place, then, an there to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115509:63"/>hear the reproval of their errors, and ſuch other admonitions, as ſhall be thought proper to reduce them into a way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: And in caſe there are any who touched with the ſence of their crimes, ſhall be willing to renounce their former deteſtable life; we ſhal prepare Colledges for them, (as there are for the penitent Whores) that they may there expiate their offences; the reſt we ſhall ſend to the Houſes of Correction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi> conſidering the great droughts which uſually rage in the houſes of the fiery Poets, during the dog-days, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the many Suns and Stars wherewith they are ſtuffed. We do therefore in that behalf, impoſe a perpetual ſilence on them, as to heavenly things.</p>
                  <p>And as there are certain Moneths in the Year, during which fiſhing and hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are inhibited, ſo we do experſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit them, not to open their veins in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Months, leaſt they ſhould ſhrink up, by reaſon of the fury and violence which then might tranſport them.</p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:115509:64"/>
                  <p>And for as much as this infernal ſect of Poets are of the ſame fraternity with the <hi>Barefoots</hi> and <hi>Carters</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: We do therefore order, as a remedy againſt their extream neceſſities, That all their works ſhall be burnt, as likewiſe their old Fringes and Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries, for the chiefer experimenting of the Philoſophers ſtone in their behalf: And that the Gold, Silver, Pearls, and all other pretious Stones which ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be produced, ſhall be reſerved for them to adorn their Goddeſſes.</p>
                  <p>Here our pedantick Doctor could no longer hold, but up he roſe all in a fury; I do declare and proteſt, ſaid he, againſt your Ordinance, and ſhall proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you in particular, if you go on any further: I appeal to the Univerſity of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> where my cauſe ought to be tryed, that I may not prejudice my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and profeſſion; and moreover then ſo I tell you, I will ſpend in proſecution of my Suit, whatever God hath ſent me in the world.

                  <p>I had much ado to forbear laughing, but that I might be kept up no longer, for it was pretty late: I told him the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was made for ſport, and in jeaft, that he who would not obey it might chuſe; that no one ſhould be forced, for that it had no ſeal of Authority. Now you ſay ſomewhat, replied he, and you have rid me of the greateſt trouble I was ever yet in; for you know what a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is to threaten a mans works with fire, who hath eight hundred thouſand Stanzas ready by him? But God forgive you the fright in which you put me; Thereupon I proceeded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> For as much as divers have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken their Idolatrous life, (though they yet retain ſome Reliques of it) and are turned Shepherds; which is the occaſion of their Cattels being ſo lean; for that

                  <p>He muſt needs be ſome Maſculine Whore, or Sodomite, or perchance a Jew, who made ſuch Ordinances, cried the poor Pedant: did I but know him, I would ſhew him a <hi>Satyr</hi> ſhould make him mad, and all thoſe who ſhould read it beſides: But I pray tell me, would it not be fine to ſee ſuch a Hermite as I ſhould make, who have no beard; Oh I ſhould ſing rarely, who have hardly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115509:65"/>voice enough to ſpeak; could make a ſhift to write , but never to Preach; Therefore I pray leave off, for if you continue to put me into any more ſuch frights, you will ſee me fall dead at your feet: No no, ſaid I, you muſt not be troubled at it , for I have already told you, it's only a piece of Drollery, and that you need believe no more then you pleaſe of it.</p>

                     <hi>Item,</hi> For the better ſuppreſſing of the many Robberies committed by thoſe Cattel called Poets.

                  <p>I fear not, ſaid the Pedant, ſmiling, of being brought under that puniſhment, for
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115509:66"/>I am but too rich in inventions, and need not borrow of others; and if you pleaſe, I will ſwear unto you, that when I take Pen in hand, they do ſometimes ſo throng upon me, that I am four hours together expecting until the firſt make way, ſo mightily do they ſtop one another.

                  <p>They who heard theſe Ordinances read, deſired copies of them, except our good Pedant, who cried out in a pet, that he need not make any defence, but would imitate the good Poets of <hi>Spain,</hi> with whom he ſaid, he was well acquainted; I am not for my own part neither, ſaid he, ſo inconſiderable as you imagine, for I have lain in the ſame

                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:115509:68"/>Now the Fates, which would not let me be alone, for fear of being in bad company, brought me to meet with a certain Souldier, whom I accoſted, and after our uſual complements, he asked me, if I came from the Court, I was onely there ſaid I, <hi>en paſsant.</hi> Indeed, replied he, with ſomewhat an ugly look, 'tis well you ſtayed there no longer, for there are none but Rogues and Raſcals live there. S'Death, I had rather for my part be in a Siege up to the middle in ſnow, and eat nothing but faggot-ſticks, than put up ſuch abuſes and tricks as they have ſerved me. Whereupon I told him, there were men of all ſorts in the Court, and queſtionleſs ſome, who knew how to reward men of valour and worth. How the devil can that be, replied he, ſeeing I was there ſix mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths ſuing for a ſcurvy Colours, after twenty years ſervice in the warrs, and the ſpending of my blood in divers occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for the Kings ſervice, as is to be ſeen by the wounds which I have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115509:68"/>With that he let down his Breeches and ſhew'd me his buttocks, where he had many ſcarrs received in the French wars, which he would needs perſwade me to be wounds of a ſword. Then he ſhew'd me his back, Look ſaid he, three piſtol-ſhots, which I receiv'd from mine enemies in defence of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and withal ſhew'd me three cuts, which were heal'd up of ſo equal a diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and juſt paralell, that I conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome Buskin had beſtowed them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with a dung-fork. I had the more reaſon to gueſs ſo, becauſe I had receiv'd ſuch another miſchance. Then he took off his Hat, and ſhew'd me a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the long ſixteens, for ſo many ſmaller cuts I could count which thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a great ſlaſh croſs his face, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his noſe. I receiv'd this blow, in <hi>Paris,</hi> in Gods and the Kings ſervice, for all which, I had never any thing but good words, which I look upon as ill payment. Read thoſe papers there, pray, for S'Death? ſaid he there is not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115509:69"/>a man living, the Devil take me if there be, ſo remarkable as I am. He had reaſon for what he ſaid, for he had ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible marks upon his face. Then he drew out of his Breeches a tin-box full of parchments, which I ſuppoſe he had ſtoln from ſome other man, whoſe name he had taken upon him. To pleaſure him I read them, and began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his great valour; I told him, that neither <hi>Syd</hi> nor <hi>Enham,</hi> two famous Marqueſſes could compare with him. How, with me ſaid he? making one ſtep backwards, no nor <hi>Garcia de Pera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> nor <hi>Julian Romero,</hi> nor many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtout men ought to be nam'd in the ſame day with me. There were no great Guns in their time, for had there been, hardly one of them would have ſtood to it, by this good light, above one hour at moſt. Pray do but go into <hi>Flanders</hi> and ask what manner of man <hi>Breachtooth</hi> is, and you ſhall hear what they'l tell you. Probably you may be the man, ſaid I to him, looking him in the face,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115509:69"/>you are in the right, replied he, do you not ſee that vacant place in my mouth, but wee'l talk no more of that, for 'tis not handſom for a man to commend himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt we were in this diſcourſe, we met an Hermite mounted upon an aſs, with a Beard almoſt down to his knees, his countenance very pale and lean, in a long gray Gown. We ſaluted him with a <hi>Deo gratias,</hi> as is the cuſtom to thoſe people; he return'd the like, and began to diſcourſe of the fairneſs of the wheat, and the Providence of God Hah dear Father, ſaid the Souldier, I have had the Pikes thicker about me, than this wheat you ſee here, and that at the Siege of <hi>Antwerp:</hi> S'death, I did all a ſtout man could do, and by this light, had —At this ſecond oath the good Hermite interrupted him, and beſought him to ſwear no more. The Souldier left off that diſcourſe. It's to be ſeen, Father, ſaid he, that you were never in the wars, in reprehending in me that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115509:70"/>thing which is moſt commendable of all others in our profeſſion. At this I could not but ſmile to my ſelf, for I began to perceive by his diſcourſe he was ſome counterfeit Braggadochio.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt we were thus diſcourſing, we came to the Port. The Hermite was ſaying over his <hi>Pater-noſters</hi> upon a rope of Beads, each whereof might well have ſerved for a bowling-Jack; The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier for his part, was comparing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Rocks with thoſe Fortreſſes and Caſtles he had ſeen, making his conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations upon the ſtrength of the place, and where would be the fitteſt ground for raiſing a Battery; Oh, ſaid he, I would quickly blow up thoſe Rocks like duſt into the air; which will be an acceptable piece of ſervice to Sea-faring men. Behold us by this arrived at <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cecedilla,</hi> We lodged all three together, we called for our Suppers, which while our Land-lord was providing, the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> ſaid unto us, it will not be amiſs if we us'd ſome diverſion till Supper-time,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115509:70"/>for <hi>Idleneſs is the Mother of all vice;</hi> Let us then play if you will for <hi>Pater-noſters,</hi> and <hi>Ave-Maries;</hi> not ſo good Father, quoth the Souldier, That kind of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney I hold to be good among ſuch reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men as you are, but, if you pleaſe, let us play for an hundred Royals, and no more, for I have always ſuch a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling ſum in reſerve to ſport away. At that I prick'd up my ears, ſaying, I would venture as much, and the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite to ſhew that he was not ill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, told us that he had an alms for the lamp of his Hermitage, to the value of two hundred Royals. When I heard that, my heart went pittepat until we were at it, for I hop'd to be the wick that ſhould ſuck up all the oil of that Lamp; but I wiſh all the <hi>Turks</hi> deſigns may thrive no better. To be ſhort, we went to dice at hazard. At firſt he told us, he underſtood not the game, which was no ſmall grief to me, we offered to teach him, as in fine we did. That bleſſed Saint did at firſt let us win ſome
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115509:71"/>of his Royals, but after a little while he gave us ſuch rude rebuffes, that he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpatch'd us, and made himſelf our Executor before our deaths. At every caſt which the Souldier loſt, he curs'd himſelf a thouſand times to the pit of Hell, with many Oaths, and I eat my fingers ends, whileſt the Hermite was imploying of his in drawing our money to him: as faſt as we call'd upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and execrated him curſing our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, he would name the Saints and Angels. After he had thus bit us, the Souldier of his hundred Royals, and me of ſix hundred, we ask'd him if he would play upon tick: He replied, he would not deal ſo rigorouſly with us, for that we were Chriſtians and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but hereafter when you play, do not ſwear; for you ſee by me, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended my ſelf to God and the Saints, how favourable fortune hath been to me. We were not ſo well skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at that trade a he was, but like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum's beleev'd him. The Souldier
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115509:71"/>ſwore not onely that he would never ſwear more, but never to play more. I did the like, Ah plague on it, ſaid he, I have been oftentimes amongſt <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> but never treated with ſo great ſeverity, and ſo little charity as by that diveliſh Hermite. In the mean time, the Hermite laugh'd at us in his ſleeve, being by this faln to his Beads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. I who had never a croſs to bleſs my ſelf withal, entreated him to bear my charges to <hi>Segovia,</hi> which he kindly did.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, we went to lodge in a great Hall, which look'd ſomewhat like an Hoſpital, for that there were ſeveral people which lodg'd there, the other chambers being all full. I went to bed indeed, but I could not ſleep a wink, my ſix hundred Royals did ſo run in my mind. The Souldier call'd for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the houſe, and deliver'd him the papers in his tin-box, with another ſmall pacquet bound up in an old ſheet. The Hermite croſs'd himſelf, we addreſs'd
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115509:72"/>our ſelves to ſleep. During the night I heard the Souldier talking to himſelf of his hundred Royals, as of a miſchief paſt cure, and I was plotting with my ſelf ſome trick to retrive my ſix hundred In the interim, it was time to riſe: The Souldier call'd for a candle, which the Chamberlain brought him. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the houſe laid his pacquet on the Table, but withal had forgot to bring him his box. Not long after, the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier looking about, and ſeeing onely his Pacquet, began to cry out as if he had been undone. Oh my buſineſs, my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs at the ſame time, the Hermite and I began to call out that ſomebody ſhould bring him his buſineſſes. In a word, we made ſuch an hurly-burly, that our Hoſt preſently got three cloſe-ſtools for us, which he brought in, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, take every one one; would you have any more, thinking we had bad ſome looſeneſs. At that the Souldier whip'd out of bed ſtark naked with his Sword in his hand, and ran after the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115509:72"/>Hoſt, ſwearing he would kill him, and ſlaſh him into an hundred thouſand pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Does he mock me, ſaid he? I'le make him know, I have been at the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Saint <hi>Quintin,</hi> and many others, and does he think to flap me in the noſe with a cloſe-ſtool inſtead of my papers, and buſineſs which I gave him in cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? All that were in the Hall began to run after him to pacifie him, but all would not do. The Maſter of the houſe ſaid to him, Sir your Worſhip did call ſo carneſtly for your buſineſſe, that I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily beleived you had ſome looſeneſſe; nor did I underſtand you call'd for your box. At laſt the buſineſs was ended, and he return'd into the Hall. During this hurly-burly I lay cloſe, watching to have made a ſcramble, in caſe the Hermite had ſtirr'd, of the booty he had yeſterday got of us, but the crafty knave was more cunning then my ſelf, for he ſtirr'd not, fearing belike ſome conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt his treaſure, and told us by way of excuſe we had put into ſo
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115509:73"/>great fear, that his heart fail'd him. All being quiet, the Hermite very liberally paid for the Souldier and my ſelf. We went through the Town to paſs the Port for my particular, I was much troubled I could not bring about my deſign: Nor far off me met with a Gennoeſe, I mean, one of thoſe Antichriſts of the Spaniſh Uſurers, with a ſerving man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him that carried a Canopy to keep the Sun from him, and by this he ſeem'd to be a rich man. We began ſeveral diſcourſes with him, which he ſtill end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Bancos and Exchanges, for they are generally a kind of people in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion are a kin to <hi>Judas,</hi> always talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Purſe. He began to name <hi>Bizance, viz.</hi> whether one might ſafely return money at <hi>Bizance:</hi> and reiterated <hi>Bizance,</hi> ſo often, that the Souldier and I asked him what that Gentleman might be; he began to ſmile, and told us it was a City in <hi>Italy,</hi> where Merchants met to ſet prizes upon monies: From this anſwer we gathered that <hi>Birance</hi> was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115509:73"/>the place where the money-taylors took their meaſures. Amongſt other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes he told us he was undone by a Bankrupt, in which he had loſt above threeſcore thouſand Crowns, which he ſaid upon his conſcience the leaſt, though for my part I beleeve that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience amongſt Merchants is like a Maiden-head in a Bauds hands, which is ſold without delivery. There is none that uſe it, for having heard that it ſtings they left it at their firſt being born with their navels.</p>
                  <p>Amidſt our diſcourſe, we came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight of <hi>Segovia,</hi> which pleaſed me very much; but the memory of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable torments I had undergone with <hi>Ragot</hi> did much take from me my content.</p>
                  <p>Coming near the City, I perceived my Father in the high-way, expecting company; I was much troubled at it, but diſſembled it the beſt I could. I took my leave of my Comrades, and went contriving how I might hear of my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115509:74"/>I rod in unknown to any one, for I had a little beard grown, and withal indifferent good clothes. I enquired of divers men where Maſter <hi>Grimpant</hi> liv'd, but I could hear nothing of him: I was exceeding glad to find ſo many honeſt men in my own Countrey. Whileſt I was in this trouble, I ſaw a number of pitiful Rogues running along and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind them; I got my ſelf up to the wall, as ſeveral others did; when behold there paſſed by a company of Halberteers, with other Officers of juſtice, and in the middle of them a rope of Penitents againſt their wills, half na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and my Uncle in the rear of them, with two-handed Handkerchiefs, with which he bruſh'd their ſhoulders, to keep of the Waſps; I was ſo neer the way where he paſſed, that he preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered me: Oh my Nephew, cried he, embracing me, pray ſtay here for me; I ſhall only take a walk with theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and return to you and carry you to dine with me: I thought I ſhould have
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115509:74"/>dyed for ſhame; for there were more Raſcals ſtaied behind to look upon me, than followed the poor Penitents; and had it not been for the money my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had left me in his hands, I would that very hour have left the City never to ſee it more; but I could do no leſs at that time then promiſe him that I would there expect him as I did; and he having diſpatch'd his buſineſs, came to me, and carryed me along with him.</p>

                  <p>THis Worſhipful Uncle of mine liv'd near the Slaughter-Houſe, the moſt infectious and noiſome place of the-whole City: This is not a Palace, ſaid he, as he went into his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but I can aſſure you, my dear Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, it is very commodious for my. Office: We went up on a Ladder to the Chamber; at the firſt ſtep I ſet my foot
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115509:75"/>on it, I lookt upwards, miſtruſting leaſt ſome diſaſter might betide me, for it look'd like the high-way to the Gallows. We entred a Chamber whoſe Roof was ſo low, that were forced to go in the ſame poſture as thoſe who receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions, <hi>viz.</hi> with our heads in our Cod-pieces: By chance I caſt my eyes upon a row of Pins, where hung all the Utenſils of his Trade; as Whips, Cords, Swords, Knives, and Branding Irons: never was Galley-ſlave more aſtoniſhed or aſhamed then my ſelf at the ſight of thoſe goodly moveables: He ask'd me why I did not lay down my Cloak, and why I did not ſit; I told him it was my cuſtome to do as he ſaw: You are very fortunate, ſaid he, in coming to me this day, for I ſhall give you ſome good cheer, there being ſome friends of mine to dine with me. In the midſt of his diſcourſe, in came a certain man in a long tawny Gown; he was one of thoſe that goes about begging for the ſouls in Purgatory and holding up his Box, ſaid to my Uncle
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115509:76"/>
                     <hi>The Souls have not been to day worth above their weight in burnt ſilk.</hi> With that he laid his Box down in a corner, and truſſing up his Gown, I ſaw his baker legs, which were made like a greek <hi>Y</hi> revers'd; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he began to dance. Is not <hi>Rapiere</hi> come yet, ſaid he? No, quoth my Uncle: Thereupon came into the Chamber a great ſcoundrel fellow, creeping on his knees, which he was forc't unto, either becauſe he was too high, or the Chamber too low. His face was all Chequer-work, flat nos'd, with a Hat like a flute glaſs, only the brims were ſo large that it might have ſerv'd for a Pent-houſe for three or four in rainy weather: a Sword he had by his ſide with more Rings about it then a Curtain rod; he was no ſooner got up, but down he ſate. I muſt needs confeſs, dear god-Father, ſaid he to my Uncle, that you have ſerv'd your Penitents to day like good children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: With that the ſouls-beggar took up the diſcourſe; they were poor ſneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Raſcals, that had not where withal to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115509:76"/>buy a kindneſs: I gave four Duckates to <hi>Fletchill,</hi> grand Beadle of <hi>Ocaigne,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend me as he did, when I was forc'd to dance a Coranto there: For my part, ſaid t'other, I did not grudge my money I gave <hi>Lobrene,</hi> when he ſerv'd me with the ſame ſawce at <hi>Mourcia,</hi> and yet the old Thief made me ſenſible that ſome one of more credit than my ſelf had recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to him. Thoſe Officers, ſaid my Uncle, interpoſing in their diſcourſe, are not men of honour, as I am; for when I treat with any one, I know how to acquit my ſelf as becomes my quality. I liſtned to theſe diſcourſes with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of regret, which that great <hi>Raga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muffin</hi> perceiving; Is that the good man that paſs'd through your hands laſt, ſaid he? No, no, ſaid my Uncle, it is a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of mine, who is Maſter of Arts in <hi>Alcala,</hi> and a very ingenuous young man: He begg'd my pardon, and proffer'd me his ſervice; for which I thank'd him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kindly, he being my Uncles aſſiſtant, who help'd him at a pinch. In the mean
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115509:77"/>time, I was almoſt mad to get my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out of my Uncles hands, that I might hye me from him. To be ſhort, the Cloth was laid, and a Cord which to my thinking was twenty yards long let down at the Window, with an old Hat at the end of it, ſuch as the Priſoners uſe in New-gate, in which they drew up four or five earthen and wooden diſhes, half broken; in which were ſeveral ſorts of meats, Tripes, Sheeps-heads, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd beef, and brains: I thought this Cord would have reach'd down to the <hi>Antipodes;</hi> but I perceiv'd that they came no further then a Tavern in a Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar under my Uncles Houſe: That done, they caſt out their line once more, and fiſh'd up half a dozen Bottles of about a Pottle a piece: Ha! ſaid I to my ſelf, that is a good draught indeed.</p>
                  <p>They ſate themſelves down, and at the upper end the bleſſed Beggar; To be ſhort, they fell to drinking, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed more Raiſins then ever came out of their mouths: they never ſpoke ſo
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115509:77"/>much as once of the deluge, for they had quite forgot water. In a word, they ſtuffed their bellies ſo full, that what with the meat, and what with the wine, the vapors crept up into their Pericrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, and maz'd them: they began to ſee double, and ſome of them to ſee ſuch things as were not neer them; for the Beggar took a Plate of fry'd Tripes which ſwam in black ſawce, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be pottage, clap'd it to his mouth to ſup it up, ſaying, 'tis good to have ſomething of ones own, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to put it into his mouth, ſpilt one half on his boſome, the t'other on his clothes; perceiving himſelf in that pickle he roſe from the Table to clean himſelf; but his head was too heavy for his body, ſo that at the firſt ſtep his noſe kiſs'd the ground: with that he took hold on the Tables foot, and endeavouring to riſe, overthrew it upon the t'other two: My Uncle try'd to get up, but being as far gone as the t'other, fell upon his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league, who finding himſelf down before
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115509:78"/>he expected it, ask'd my Uncle why he puſht him, and whether he uſed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his gueſts ſo; and with that he took a bone, which by chance was in his hand intending to ſlay my Uncle who lay at full length dead drunk; but gettng up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his knees, with his arm lift up, as good luck would have it, inſtead of ſtriking him, he ſpewed up all his Tripes upon his face.</p>
                  <p>For my part I did not ſit down with them, but contented my ſelf with a piece of bread and a glaſs of wine; for I did ſo nauſeate the naſtineſs of their meat, that I could not for my heart eat of it; ſo that I was in a condition to help my Uncle, which I did, though with much ado: At laſt I got him up and laid him on his bed, after he had bid a jugg good night, which he miſtook for one of his gueſts. In the mean time the other two were a ſleep on the floor: When I ſaw them all faſt, I got out of the Chamber to take the aire, and to deliver my ſelf from their infections: I entertain'd my
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115509:78"/>ſelf with walking up and down the City all that evening. I paſſed by <hi>Ragots</hi> Houſe, where I heard the news of his death, I muſt needs confeſs I was not much troubled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> it, nor did I enquire of what he dyed; for I ſuppoſed famine had at laſt got the upper hand of him: After four hours march I return'd to our Lodging, where I found one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany crawling upon all four, groping for the door, and crying, ſomebody had run away with the Chamber: I help'd him up and let t'other alone, who waked not till about eleven the clock: One of them being come to himſelf asked what a clock 'twas? my Uncle yet old-drunk anſwer'd him, 'twas about noon, and that he had beſt repoſe himſelf till the heat of the day were paſt. The Beggar took his Gown and got to the window, thinking he had been at the door, and ſo was marching off, but looking up, he ſaw the Stars, come hither, come hither, ſaid he to the others, the Skie is full of ſtars at mid-day; ſure there has been
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115509:79"/>ſome very geeat Eclipſe: my Uncle and his companions bleſſed themſelves with the ſigne of the Croſs, and kiſſing the ground, prayed that they might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from all perils and dangers. I did what I could to contain my ſelf till morning, which at laſt to my great joy came; and then away went our gueſts.</p>
                  <p>Finding my ſelf alone with my Uncle, who had a little recover'd himſelf; I began to diſcourſe to him of my inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but he being a man who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood little of good behaviour, put me to a great deal of trouble before I could bring him to my own bow; but at length he yeilded, though with ſome reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for I could only make him bleed three of the four hundred Ducates, my Father left me, which he had gotten by his handi-craft, and entruſted with a perſon of Honour, who was the Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of all the thefts committed within ten Leagues of <hi>Segovia:</hi> To her we went who received us with many welcomes, wiſhing that I might prove as honeſt and

The Ducates were told out in good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney my Uncle ſeeing me taking poſſeſſion of my inheritance; my dear Nephew, ſaid he, you will do very ill, ſhould you ſquander away this money; did I not know you to be a perſon of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and withal mindful of the family from whence we are deſcended, I ſhould be more wary of delivering it into your hands; but there it is, God give you grace to make good uſe of it, and then perchance you may enjoy ſome part of my labours: I return'd him many thanks for his kind offers; and having paid my ſhot, my Uncle and I rerurn'd to our damn'd Lodging, where we no ſooner were, but up came his Colleague, unto whom my Uncle gave an account of what we had done: I ſaw my ſelf oblig'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſome wine upon them; I perceiv'd by the countenance and diſcourſe of that Pot companion, that he had ſome deſign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Purſe: but by good fortune, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had ply'd them with ſtore of wine,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115509:80"/>they fell aſleep, which I no ſooner ſaw, but without more ado, away I got me, full of reſpect, for I made not the leaſt noiſe to wake them: I lock'd the door after me, and threw the key in at a little hole. I went and got me a lodging a good way off from that place, deſigning to go to Court: but to obſerve a <hi>Decorum</hi> a word which I have heard in the Latine Countrey, and amongſt the Pedantick Rabble: I reſolv'd to ſend a Letter to my Uncle, and to give him an account of my ſudden departure, which I did, and returning to his Lodging, found them as I left them: I threw in my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the door, which was to this effect.</p>

                  <p>ALL things fell out according to my hearts deſire; for when I came back to my Lodging, I found a Waggoner going for <hi>Madrid:</hi> he had an Aſs, which I hir'd of him; I roſe betimes in the morning, and went out of the City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: I had not gone far before he overtook me, and ſo I began my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, curſing my kindred, and thinking with my ſelf what cholar, rage, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations my Uncle and his Colleague did vomit out againſt me, at the receipt of my Letter.</p>

                  <p>In the mean time I was accoutred much like <hi>Sancho Panza, Don Quixot's</hi> Squire: I wiſh'd very heartily that I might not meet any one in the way, leaſt I would looſe my ſelf, when as I perceiv'd not far from me a certain young man, who ſeem'd to be a Taſſel of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he was booted and ſpur'd, had a great lac'd Collar, his Cloak upon one ſhoulder, his Sword dagling in his Belt, with a ſtick in his hand, as if he had been walking in expectation of ſome compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I preſently concluded it was ſome Knight that had left his train behind him: I accoſted him with a ſalute, he beheld me, ſaying, Peradventvre Sir, you are going to Court: I am Sir, replyed I; you ſeem by your countenance, ſaid he, upon that beaſt, to be leſs weary then I am with all my Equipage: I thought he had ſpoken of ſome Coach which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him: for my part, ſaid I, I find more eaſe in travelling upon this beaſt, then in a Coach, nor indeed would I willingly change with you, for the toſſing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115509:82"/>and tumbling makes my head ake: what do you abuſe me, ſaid he? do you know whom you ſpeak to? and at that word he came back to me in ſome anger; but being tyed about with one only point and that old too, his Breeches fell about his heels and diſcover'd all his poor Arſe to the open ayre, for his ſhirt was ſo ſhort that it would not cover the bottom of his belly: He could not ſo quickly truſs them up again, but I had ſeen all his ſecrecies, which forc'd me to turn about, and ſtop my mouth with my Handkerchief, to ſtifle a fit of laughter which was ready to ſurpriſe me; and he who knew not what to do, entreated me to lend him a point, Sir, ſaid I, unleſs you expect your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you may ſtay long enough in the condition you are in, for I cannot help you, having but one ſingle Point my ſelf; if you intend to jeer me, replied he, you had beſt keep on your way, for I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not what you mean by Coach and Attendants: To be ſhort, in half a Leagues travelling together he diſcover'd
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115509:82"/>himſelf to me in ſuch effectual terms, that he gave me to underſtand, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I would do him the favour to let him get up behind me, he could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly get to the Court, ſo weary he was with going on foot with his Breeches in his hands: I was good natur'd, ſo I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, and help'd him up which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſiſtance he could never have done, for he had but one hand at liberty, his t'other being on his point; but I was much aſtoniſh'd whileſt I was doing him that good office, for his Breeches were ſo pittifully torn, that I had his bare arſe in my hand. He perceiving the diſcovery I had made, told me, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet man as he was, Sir, all is not gold that gliſters, when you firſt ſaw me with this great lac'd collar, you thought me to be ſome Earl of <hi>Gaſcoign</hi> at leaſt, but I beſeech you know, there are many honeſt men in the world as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as my ſelf. I did what I could to perſwade him I knew not what he meant. How, ſaid he, have you ſeen nothing?
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115509:83"/>that cannot be, for one might eaſily have ſeen all that I had: You beheld a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman whom if the Nobility did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as I maintain it, I ſhould not want any thing; but Sir, we live in an age where without meat and drink, Nobility can neither be ſuſtain'd nor maintain'd; nor indeed ſhould one in my condition call himſelf Gentleman, for there is no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility in miſery: I regard not thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Nobility, ſince upon a certain day I found my ſelf faſting very late, and one refus'd to truſt me with a loaf and half a pint of wine upon it. I have ſold what ever I could make in the world to ſupply my wants: The Goods of my Father which was call'd <hi>Torrinio Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, Ballaio, Gomez, D' Ampovero,</hi> were ſeiz'd upon for another mans debt; I have only the <hi>Don</hi> left to ſell; but ſuch is my misfortune, that <hi>I</hi> can meet with no body that will lay out money upon it, for they who are not of quality to put it before, have got a trick to put it after their names; as <hi>Coridon, Bourdon, Grillardon,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115509:83"/>Randon, Gueridon, Brandon,</hi> and ſuch like. I proteſt to you, that though, me thought the calamities of that poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman were ridiculous, yet I found good diverſion in his company. I ask'd him his name, whither he went, and what his affairs were? He nam'd all his Fathers Titles, and added thoſe of <hi>Cardan</hi> and <hi>Lourdain:</hi> When I heard him at this paſs, I thought verily I had heard the noiſe of bells, ſounding <hi>Din Dan Don:</hi> He told me, he was going to Court; for ſaid he, it ill beſeems a man in my condition to live in the Countrey; and to tell you the truth, I ſeldom trouble my ſelf to enquire the priſes of Oyl &amp; Butter, having not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to buy any; for this reaſon I betake me to that place as a common receptacle of all Bravo's, where open houſe is kept all they year long, with ſeveral Tables for all comers and goers, ſuch whoſe bellies cry cup-board before eleven of the Clock; there is my abode, and I am ſeldom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an hundred Royals in my Pocket, or a good Lodging, and ſo I ſpend my time

Amongſt the reſt, there is one ſort of people, of which Order I my ſelf am, who have neither Goods nor Chattels, moveable or immoveable, in poſſeſſion or reverſion; We are generally call'd
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115509:85"/>
                     <hi>Knights</hi> of the <hi>Induſtry.</hi> Now becauſe there are ſeveral ranks, we have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular names by which they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd. Some are call'd <hi>Cloak-twitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> others <hi>Pick-pockets,</hi> others <hi>Setters,</hi> others <hi>Snaps,</hi> others <hi>Trappaners,,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Hectors,</hi> others <hi>Lyons, Free-boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and the like; by which their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions are differenced: We have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd the Title of <hi>Induſtry,</hi> becauſe ſhe is our guide and Protectreſs. Our moſt uſual food is, that of the Camele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for our ſtomach's are ſeldom fil'd with ought but air, it being a work of great labour when we drain our nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from another mans Kitchin: We are the deſtruction of Banquets, the Sponges of Taverns, and the Gueſts of the forc'd Put; however we live to our content: we are a people that feed upon an Onyon, and yet with a tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick in our mouths, pretend to have eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a Capon. If any one makes us a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, he is ſure to find our chambers ſtrow'd over with bones of mutton or
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115509:86"/>fowl, with parings of fruit, a feather-tub, or Rabbets-feet; all which we had pick'd up in the Streets in the night to credit us: preſently we would cry out, I ſee it is impoſſible for me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with my ſervants to make clean the room any ſooner. I beg your pardon Sir, for I have had ſome friends with me, and theſe wicked Raſcals — They who knew us not would beleeve us. But what ſhall I tell you of our <hi>Free-Booters?</hi> If at any time we ſpeak but half a word with any man, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently force an acquaintance upon him, we enquire out his lodging, and juſt at dinner-time we go to wait upon him, and tell him the inclination we had to honour and ſerve him, obliged us to that viſit: that we are charm'd with his ingenuity and incomparable parts. If he ask us whether we have din'd, and we find the cloth going to be laid, we anſwer not yet; and if we find the cloth taken away, we tell him yes. If he once ſpeak to us to ſtay, we never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115509:86"/>a ſecond invitation, for we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found our ſelves deceiv'd of our dinners by ſuch ſtraining of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. When we are ſet at Table, though the Maſter of the houſe know ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo well how to carve, yet we tell him (the better to lick our fingers) If you pleaſe Sir, give it me, I ſhall help you. I remember <hi>Don</hi> ſuch an one, God bleſs his Soul, (and then we name ſome deceaſed Duke or Marqueſs) would take greater delight to ſee me cut up a Partridge or Pheaſant, than to eat of it, and then we take the fork and the knife, and cut it up. Oh how finely it ſmells, then ſay we, indeed you would wrong your Cook not to taſte of it: What an excellent fellow 'tis! and thus we ſtuff our guts.</p>
                  <p>If perchance thoſe Opportunities fail us, then we have recourſe to the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadge-pot of ſome Convert, and we tell him that gives the Dole, we came more out of devotion than neceſſity. It is worth a mans ſight to behold one of us
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115509:87"/>at an Ordinary where play is, we are the moſt ſerviceable people in the world, we ſnuff the Candles, bring the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-pots, and rejoyce at the winners good luck, and all this for ſix pence, which the winner beſtowes upon us. For our clothes we know where the Frippery is, and becauſe there is a ſet hour in divers places for Prayers, we have alſo ſet times for mending our clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes.</p>
                  <p>To ſee the diverſity of things that we do, is an incomparable paſtime: we look upon the Sun as our mortal enemy, becauſe he diſcovers our patches and tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. In the morning we lay our ſelves a ſunning, and leaning down our heads, we behold upon the ground the ſhadow of the threads and jaggs which hang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, then with a pair of Ciſſers we trim our apparell; and becauſe moſt commonly we firſt wear out our clothes between our legs, we draw out ſome pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces off the Rear to reinforce the Van; ſo that we are very careful ever after how
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115509:87"/>we lay off our cloaks, as alſo how we mount any ladder or tree, unleſs by compulſion. We practiſe our poſtures in the Sun-ſhine; at day time we walk cloſe-legg'd, and make our ſalutations without parting our knees, leſt if we ſhould do otherwiſe, the embroideries of our py-bald breeches ſhould be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. To be ſhort, there is not any thing we wear that had not ſometimes another property, and of which one might derive another pedigree. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, I pray, this cloak which I wear, it is deſcended in a direct line from a horſe-cloth, which was the daughter of a quondam coverlet. My Breeches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from three chairs covered with green cloth, whoſe Grand-father was a boat-tilt: my Doublet was the Son of a skreen, begotten of the furniture of a Billiard-table, and in ſhort time will be converted into ſocks.</p>
                  <p>We are very careful of coming neer candles, if at night-times we are in any company; for fear of diſcovering the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115509:88"/>baldneſs and threed bareneſs of our cloaks, from which a man might ſhave as much as from a ſtone. It hath pleas'd heaven to beſtow on us a beard, which it hath denyed our garments. We are alſo very ſollicitous how we frequent ſuch houſes as are cuſtomed by any of our companions, leſt they ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare with one another, and upon that account our bellies are ſometimes jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. We are tied by our orders to ride once a moneth, either on an horſe, or a cole-ſtaffe, it matters not which, and once a year in a Coach, at which times we endeavour to get into the boot, that all our acquaintance may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of us: to which end we carry our bodies as far out of the Coach as we can, that we may not looſe any opportunity of being ſeen. If perchance we feel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing biting us, or the regiment of lice too importunate with us, we want not inventions to remove them before any company without the leaſt diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: as for example, we talk of ſome bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115509:88"/>and tell that a certain Souldier of our acquaintance had a ſlaſh from ſuch a place to ſuch a place in his body, and with that we ſcratch where it itches, and thus we comply with our neceſſity. If we ſhould be thus ſurpris'd at Church, and they ſhould bite upon our breaſts, we fall to the <hi>Sanctus,</hi> though it be not yet the <hi>Introibo.</hi> If it take us behind, we get us to ſome Pillar, and ſeeming to look up at ſomething, we heave up our ſelves, and ſo rub our ſelves at our pleaſures: for matter of lying, you muſt know the word Truth never comes into our mouths. We always bring in head and ſhoulders ſome Duke or Earl into our diſcourſe, ſome as our Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, others as our friends, but with this caution, that they be either deceas'd or far enough from us; and that which is very remarkeable amongſt us, is, we are never in love, unleſs with <hi>de pane lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crando,</hi> for our Order doth expreſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn us to avoid the acquaintance of any Ladies, eſpecially ſuch who are more
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115509:89"/>apt to receive than give, be they never ſo honourable or handſome; ſo that we are forc'd to make addreſſes to the Cooks for our meals, to the Hoſteſſes for our Lodgings, and ſo to all others of whom we may make any advantage. To proceed, do you ſee theſe boots here? You would think now that I have Stockings under them, but you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, for I am both poor and bare, and whoever ſhould ſee my collar, would hardly imagine I ſhould want a ſhirt: but what need I tell you, you know already how the caſe ſtands with me; however a Knight may deny himſelf thoſe other things, but his collar he may not, becauſe it ſerves for an ornament to his perſon. To conclude Sir, a Knight who would be of our Order in perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ought to want as many neceſſaries as a Cockney ſetting out a journey: ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perhaps he may have a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in his pocket, at other times be in an Hoſpital eating of parch'd Peaſe, and thus we live in the Court, where who ſo
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115509:89"/>knows how to advance his <hi>Induſtry,</hi> paſſes his time like a diſguis'd Prince.</p>
                  <p>Never was man ſo aſtoniſh'd as my ſelf at the recital of this Order of Knight hood, which ſo pleas'd me, that we got to <hi>Rozas</hi> before night, or our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I' me ſure he made a Cully of me for the honour of his order, for he rid my mule, and made me beat it upon the hoof, and not onely ſo but I was forc'd to pay his reckoning, he having neither face nor croſs about him. His diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made a deep impreſſion in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and I reſolved to make uſe of them as occaſion ſhould ſerve, for that I found my inclinations tending toward that <hi>Fraternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I went to ſleep, I made him my privy Councellor, by acquainting him with my intentions, which ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd him, that he hugg'd me over and over again, and told me he could not but beleeve the recital he had made me, was perſwaſive enough to work upon a man of my ingenuity. He offered me
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115509:90"/>his aſſiſtance in order to my introduction into the <hi>Fraternity</hi> of the <hi>Induſtry,</hi> and not onely ſo but into their Colledg too. I took him at his word, and gave him many thanks, but did not diſcover what monies I had, onely an hundred Royals, which were enough to gain me his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The next morning I bought him three codpiſs-points, and ſet out early towards <hi>Madrid.</hi>

I obſerved that he always kept his Cloak very cloſe over his breaſt, and being a Novice, I had the curioſity to enquire the reaſon of it; my friend and brother, ſaid he, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115509:91"/>my Doublet is all greaſie, and my ſhoulders worn out: it was not long though, ere he quitted his Cloak to louſe himſelf: With that I began to perceive that inſtead of Breeches, he had two wiſps of ſtraw, which reach'd from his middle to his knees, for he had neither ſhirt, nor ſhirt like; Me thought he was ſo naked, that he ſeem'd to be an Adamite, ſo that a Louſe had no ſhelter with him: Every one there did freely diſcover his neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; whereupon my Tutor told him, I came out of the Countrey with a great Rent-charge in my Breeches, which had need of a recruit; and turning towards the old woman, asked her if ſhe had any raggs, of green cloth, in her Wardrobe; for as ſhe walkt the City, ſhe ever uſed to have the Taylors ſhreds into her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, <hi>a la mode de,</hi> Ragg-man; I have neither green nor grey, ſaid ſhe; and for that very reaſon <hi>Don Granger</hi> hath kept his bed this fortnight, his cloaths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo weak that they fall to pieces like Tinder for want of patches to ſtrengthen them.</p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:115509:92"/>
                  <p>Thereupon in comes an <hi>Induſtrious,</hi> I mean a Knight of the Order, his Boots on, in grey, with an Hat pin'd up on both ſides; he ſoon ſpied me, and ſeeing a ſtrange face, asked who I was; being inform'd, he gave me the welcome; with that he diſmantled himſelf, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the forepart of his Doublet was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of cloth, but it was not ſo with the hinder part, which was Canvas. I could hardly forbear laughing when I ſaw it, which he obſerving; In good time, ſaid he, you and I ſhall be better acquainted; I'le lay a wager with you, you do not know why I wear my Hat pin'd up on both ſides. It is, ſaid I, for gallantry, and your better proſpect: No, no, ſaid he, quite contrary, it is to prevent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, for it hath two great ſpots of greaſe on it, which by this means are kept in the dark: With that he drew out twenty Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and about as many Royals: My Tutor inform'd me that the induſtry of that Knight was to go in this Equipage, and to carry papers folded up like Letters
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115509:92"/>directed to perſons of Quality, and being very cautious that ſuch people were not at home, he would deliver the Letters, for which he received ſix pence <hi>per</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and how he uſed this Trade as often as he could, but with care to make his addreſſes to new faces. Next came in two together, diſputing as they knockt at the Gate; one had an Handkerchief about his neck, inſtead of a Collar, with a couple of holſters at his girdle, and a Reſt in his hand for his <hi>Plymouth-Cloak;</hi> a Crutch under his Arm, and one of his legs tyed up with old Rags and Cunny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins, for he had but one Stocking and one Shoe: He paſs'd for a Souldier, and a man who had been in the low Countries and ſeen hot ſervice; for my part, I had no more wit then to believe it; he reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned up the many ſervices he had done his Majeſty, and under the notion of a Souldier, had free acceſs every where: The t'other had a maim'd Doublet on, to hide which, he wore his Cloak like a Scarfe, wrapt about his left arm, which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115509:93"/>without that had been ſtark naked: He cryed out aloud, half of it is mine, or at leaſt a good part; and unleſs you deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it me, I ſwear— Do not ſwear, ſaid the Cripple, let us get in firſt, and I ſhall let you feel that I have hands and feet too, enough to break my Crutch about thy ears. Thou ly'ſt, and thou too: With that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to't they went, and in a trice the place was ſtrewed over with Shoulders, Sleeves, Skirts; and in a word, with more of their clothes then were left upon their backs: In good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, I took him for a piece of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: We ran in to part them; but we knew not where to lay hold to looſe them; how, quoth the counterfeit Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, art thou ſo impudent as to pretend to a ſhare in my booties? and with that inform'd us with the ground of their quarrel: You muſt know Gentlemen, ſaid he, that as I was ev'n now at St. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours,</hi> a little Boy came to yon'd Raſcal and ask'd him if I were not Captain <hi>John Lawrence?</hi> he told him I was, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115509:93"/>becauſe he ſaw the boy brought me ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he came along with him, ſaying, Captain, there's a Boy deſires to ſpeak with you: The Boy delivered me a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of Handkerchiefs which his Mother had ſent me, and preſently this Raſcalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would have half of them; but I'le firſt give him half a hundred good bangs: I'le have them all for my own uſe, or make them uſeleſs: The controverſie was decided by a Decree of the Officers of the Order, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſhould be delivered into the hands of the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for the common ſtock, to ſerve for falſe ſhirts, as occaſion ſhould require. Night drew on, and we went to ſleep, but we all lay cloſe to one another as our skins to our backs; As for Supper we had none, for fear of ſurfeting, and ſome of us too were not much troubled with putting off our clothes.</p>

                     <hi>Buſcon</hi> being to practice in this Order, ſnap'd a Cully, and cheated a whore.</head>
                  <p>AFter ſome time it pleas'd God day appear'd, and we betook our ſelves to our tackling. I was already as inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with them, as if I had been their brother all days of my life, for in evil things there is always an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſomething of pleaſure, which drils on them it enticeth. It was pretty to ſee a Shirt put on of a twelve-moneths wearing; to hear another asking for a Quarter-maſter to take up a lodging for him in his own Doublet, which he could hardly do in a days time; Another ſew'd his Comrades Doublet under the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, who in the mean while ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and ſtretching out one arm, look'd
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115509:94"/>juſt like the Letter L with the heels up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: another mending his breeches between his knees, and ſitting croſs-legg'd, look'd like an <hi>Indian</hi> Tortoiſe. To be ſhort, <hi>Boſcan</hi> never invented half ſo many poſtures in all his pictures, as were here preſented to the life. This ended, they went the viſitation, to ſee if all were right amongſt them. Then every mans quarter was allotted him; for my own part I had a great mind to ſhow my ſelf liberal at my admiſſion. I told them I would deliver my clothes into the common Treaſury, and that I would make another with my hundred Royals. No, no ſaid they, we ſhall find out by ſome <hi>Induſtry</hi> to cloath you without laying out your money: We have ſtuff enough left to furniſh you, and your hundred Royals ſhall be put into the common ſtock.</p>
                  <p>I lik'd their contrivance very well, and willingly deliver'd them my money. Preſently they fell upon me, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off my Caſſock about four fingers
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115509:95"/>below my waſte, they made a jacket of it, they likewiſe circumcis'd ſome half yard off my cloak, which however was of an indifferent length: all theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings were truck'd off for an old double dy'd hat; they gave me a pair of Spaniſh leather boots, which reach'd but to the calfs of my legs. I was furniſh'd with a collar, which to ſay the truth, was pretty well to paſs before, but behind in a pitiful taking, when they put it about my neck; You muſt be very <hi>Induſtrious</hi> ſaid they, to ſatisfie the vanity of the world. This collar ſavours of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore remember that when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one eyes you, you ſtill face him, like the Marigold that turns to the Sun. If there be two of them, march up, take off your Hat towards your Pole, that ſo you may cover the nakedneſs of your collar. If any one ask you why you uſe that poſture, tell him 'tis not good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to ſhow the Poſteriors. After theſe inſtructions, they gave me a ſmall tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-box with it's appurtenances, as alſo
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115509:95"/>a little box of black and white threed a pair of dice, a couple of needles, and divers ſhreds of linnen and woollen, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a ruſty indented pair of Ciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers. Now ſaid they, accoutred as you are, you may travel all the world over without being beholden to father or friend. As for my quarter, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd me that of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> where I might go free-booting as others did: The truth is, in regard I was a Novice, they committed me to the tuition of that ſame perſon which had firſt introduc'd me to this honourable Fraternity. Well, out we went very ſoberly with our beads in our hands, and took our walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Quarter, we ſaluted very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately ſuch as we met withal, we pull'd off our hats to every one, wiſhing at the ſame inſtant we could do as much to their cloaks: we complemented the women, a thing they delight in, as alſo their <hi>Father-hood's.</hi> My prudent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour would be always ſaying ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to moſt of thoſe he met; to one,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115509:96"/>to morrow I ſhall receive money; to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, pray excuſe me one day longer, for I have to do with a Merchant that puts me off from time to time. One would ask him for the cloak he had lent him, another for his hat, and a third for his belt. By this I perceiv'd my Governour was ſo great a lover of his friends, that he wore not any thing that did not belong to ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>We went skulking through the ſtreets ſometimes on one ſide, and ſometimes on another, the better to avoid certain ſhops, in whoſe books my Governors name was written in a large Character. On a ſuddain there met him a man, who demanded ſome houſe-rent of him, who was no ſooner gone with a flea in his ear, but not a farthing in his pocket, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother puts him in mind of paying him for his ſword, a third for his ſhirt; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I perceived there were as well Hackney-knights as Hackney-horſes, and that my worſhipful Governor was one of them, As we were thus coaſting
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115509:96"/>up and down, he diſcovered a certain Dun, a good way off him, who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten haunted him for ſome ſmall trifling debt, now that he might not be known, he drawes out his hair, which at that time was clap'd behind his eares, (as the Spaniſh mode is) and pull'd a Plaiſter of black Taffata out of his Pocket, which he layes juſt upon one of his eyes, and therewithal began to ſpeak Italian to me, In the mean time up came our Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and having eyed my Tutor, began to recollect into his memory, that he had ſomewhere ſeen him, of which to be certain, he made three or four turns about us, at laſt he croſs'd himſelf, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaid he, I took him for ſuch a one, and wanted but little of running my ſelf into a Premunire. I thought I ſhould have dyed with laughing, what at the ſtrange diſguiſe of the Debtor and what at the great aſtoniſhment of the Creditor, who was no ſooner gone from us, but we got us into a porch, where my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor re-aſſum'd his former counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115509:97"/>and ſaid unto me, thus you ſee dear Brother, that we are forced to our Induſtry, for theſe and the like devices, to conceal our ſelves from thoſe unto whom we ſtand indebted, elſe we might go whiſtle in a Cage, oftner then we would. On we march'd, and at the corner of a ſtreet, we took each of us, about half a glaſs of ſtrong-water, which a good woman beſtowed upon us, I can aſſure you ſaid ſhe, it is a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Cordial to a faſting ſtomach, and in the ſtrength of it, a man may well forbear meat for ſome hours; at leaſt a little of this in the morning is better then nothing all the day after. My ſtomach will never believe the former propoſal ſaid I, which I think to be a Paradox, whereupon my Guide replied, you are a man of weak faith, both as to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of Religion, or our <hi>Order.</hi> The Lord is not wanting to the Crowes and Ravens, will he, think you, forſake the poor Knights of the <hi>Induſtry?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the midſt of our diſcourſe, we
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115509:97"/>heard a clock ſtrike twelve, now I being but a novice in this manner of life, my belly would not be ſo eaſily put off with that ſmall draught of <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> which I had drank, but began to call upon me, as if I had not drank a drop; with that, I turn'd me to my Companion, ſaying, methinks I find it ſomewhat a ſtrict diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, at my firſt comming, to be kept thus long faſting, eſpecially ſeeing I uſe to have a ſtomach like an horſe, and to feed like a Farmer, and now on a ſuddain, you make me obſerve Vigils, which are not mark'd in the Kalender. For your part, it's no great wonder, if your appetite be not ſo early up as mine, for you being born and bred up in the regions of hunger, may by this have brought your ſelf to ſuch a paſs, that you may almoſt live by the Peſtle of a Lark, or dine with Duke <hi>Humphrey</hi> a week together, but otherwiſe it is with me, who never uſed to read ſuch faſting Lectures to my Guts: And ſeeing you take no greater care to kill that which
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115509:98"/>will kill me; I pray excuſe me if I leave you to go make ſome proviſions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to allay thoſe ſtorms and thunders which I perceive are ingendring in my Bowels. You are a great Greedigut, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, it hath hardly made an end of ſtriking twelve, and you preſently cry out you are a hungry, as if you had not eaten a morſel of bread theſe three days; but I ſee you are very devout in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your guts; a beaſt would do as much, but you muſt learn a new Leſſon, and know that ſobriety is that which keeps us in health and vigor: To be ſhort, you ſhall not any where find it recorded; that any one of the Induſtrious Knights did ever eaſe his ſtomach, high or low, one way or t'other, upwards, or downwards. have I not already told you that God is all-ſufficient, and never wanting unto any one; but ſeeing you are in ſuch haſt to be exerciſing your Teeth, fare-you-well, for my part I'me going to the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage Pot of the <hi>Fathers of the Oratory;</hi> if you have a mind to go with me ſo, if
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115509:98"/>not ſo, every one for himſelf: Adieu then ſaid I, for my ſtomach is ſo torn, that it will not be mended by others ſcraps and leavings: He took one way I another, but I had not gone many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before I ſtop'd at a corner houſe, that I might ſee how my companion would diſpoſe of himſelf; when as I perceiv'd he drew a little Box out of his Pocket, full of ſmall crumbs, which he carried about him for that uſe, ſome he took out, and ſtrew'd upon his Doublet and Beard, that People might think he had been at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For my own particular, I truſted to my money, yet not without ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy as to my own conſcience; ſeeing the Statutes of our Order of Induſtrie did expreſly inhibit any one from eating at his own coſt and charge, but I found my ſelf ſo hard preſs'd by hunger, that I was forc'd to have recourſe to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, which ſaith, <hi>Neceſsity hath no Law,</hi> and therupon I reſolved to do as I might.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt I was thus deviſing with my ſelf I found I was juſt at the corner of St.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115509:99"/>
                     <hi>Lewis</hi> ſtreet, where there dwelt a Cook; on a ſudden the ſmell of a ſix-penny Pie newly drawn out of the Oven, took me in the noſe, and forc'd me to make a full ſtand, juſt like a ſetting-dog, when he winded a Covie of Partridges: I caſt my eyes upon it, and withal my mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to water; me thoughts the Pie did ever and anon waſt it ſelf by my looking on it; ſometimes I was contriving how I might ſteal it, and anon I reſolved to buy it, and ſo to eat it; but as good luck would have it, in the midſt of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, I perceived a certain Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Arts of my acquaintance, called <hi>Baldinus,</hi> who had a moſt rich face of his own, for his noſe was very coſtly, beſet with Rubies, ſome as big as the top of ones little finger, with a belly like an Abbot: He had no ſooner ſpied me, but he caſt himſelf about me, with no little admiration to ſee me; for in the habit I then was, it was hard for any one to know me: Behold us then putting off Hats, and making of leggs; he ask'd me how
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115509:99"/>I did? I have ſomething to tell you Sir, ſaid I, but ſuch is my condition, that I muſt needs go out of Town this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon: I am very ſorry for that, replied he, and were it not ſo late, for I think it be near one, I ſhould gladly leave my dinner a while, that we might walk a turn or two together; but the truth is, I fear my Siſter and her Husband are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of me. How ſaid I, is your Siſter in Town? nay then, though I ſtay in Town all night, or come what will, I muſt kiſs her hands: Now you muſt know I had a greater mind to paſs a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement upon my Belly then his Siſter, for when I heard him talk of their ſtaying for him at Dinner, I began to open my ears, and take opportunity by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock. Away I went with him, any by the way I put him in mind of a Miſtreſs of his, one he had very much loved, and told him I knew where ſhe was, and how to introduce him into the houſe where ſhe lived; that is, in plain Engliſh, I would pimp for him; at that he was more
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115509:100"/>pleas'd, then I with the conceit of dining with him, ſo well I knew where to tickle him, that I made him ſmile upon me.</p>
                  <p>During our diſcourſe, we came to his Siſters lodging, whom I ſaluted, and preſented my ſervice unto her Husband; they ſeeing me, and at ſuch an hour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded I intended to dine with them, as indeed I did; whereupon they began to make excuſes, and Apoligies; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, I was one of the houſe, their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient acquaintance, and beſeeched them not to treat me with Ceremony.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Baldinus</hi> ſeeing me of a ſudden ſo intimately acquainted, began to be a maz'd, for he had not ſo much as ſpoken to me to ſtay Dinner; I perceiv'd it, and began to reaſſume my former diſcourſe, which I knew would lenifie him afreſh: I told him how the Gentlewoman could never forget him, that ſhe had often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of me how he did? and where he was with many other the like inventions: We had not ſtayed long before Dinner came up, and every one ſate him down:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115509:100"/>I preſently fell to it, with both hands, and all my teeth: They had ſet me a diſh of Broth by my ſelf, which vaniſhed at two ſups; then I aſſaulted the other diſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es with ſuch haſte, that our Ordinary was ſooner diſpatch'd, then an Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Poſt would have been riding half a Mile. The Cloth was taken away, but not one bit of meat with it: Maſter <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinus</hi> and my ſelf, withdrew apart, that we might end our diſcourſe concerning the Nimph I had told him of, and that I might acquaint him with the means to get to her, which I aſſur'd him might be effected with eaſe and ſafety. As we were thus talking together, leaning at a Window, I made as if ſomebody in the ſtreet had called me; Sir, ſaid I aloud, that every one might hear me, I'le waite on you immediately, and therewithal took leave of the company, promiſing them to return in half an hour at fartheſt, though I never intended it, for from that day to this I never went neer them.</p>
                  <p>After I got into the ſtreet, I walked
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115509:101"/>up and down towards the Gate of <hi>Guada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lajara,</hi> and ſate me down upon a Bench juſt before a Silk-mans Shop: I had not been long there, before two women, ſuch as uſe to borrow not upon their Goods, but their Perſons, came towards the ſame Shop; they let me ſee half of their faces, the t'other being cover'd with a thin Hood; they were attended by their old women, and their little Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, (thoſe go-betweens) they asked if there were any new faſhioned ſtuffs: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this I began to ſpeak to one of them, and found how they hoped my being there would help them to ſome credit in the Shop before which I ſate; now as he who hath nothing to looſe runs no ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I proferred them all the aſſiſtances I could to ſerve them: They returned me thanks, but in ſuch a way as Doctors and Lawers uſe, who refuſe the money they intend to take, for they replied, they were not ſuch women as uſed to receive from thoſe whom they knew not: At this reply I began to make my excuſes
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115509:101"/>unto them; for that I had not proffer'd to preſent them any thing, but did now beſeech them to accept of a piece of ſtuff newly brought me from <hi>Milan,</hi> which if they pleaſed ſo far to honour me, I would ſend them that night by a Page, who ſtood bare headed ſome ſix paces of waiting for his Maſter, who was prizing of ſome Stuffs in the Shop; him I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to belong unto me; and to make them conceive the better opinion of me, and that I was a Perſon of Quality, I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the Magiſtrates and Gentlemen that paſſed by in their Coaches, with ſo familiar a Garb, as if I had been intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with them. What by this, and what by letting them ſee my money which I did, as if by accident, as I was giving a ſmall piece to a poor beggar, I had abſolutely poſſeſſed them with an opinion that I was a man of Quality; whereupon they took their leaves very civily of me, having firſt acquainted me where they dwelt, and how I might beſt ſend my Page unto them. I begg'd of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115509:102"/>them by way of favour and gallantry, a certain ſtring of Gold Beads, which the handſomeſt of the two did wear, at firſt ſhe made ſome excuſes, ſaying it was of too ſmall worth for me to own, but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied I had a very great fancie and eſteem for it, ſince ſhe had worn it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal offered them my hundred Crowns of Gold in pawn for it: At laſt they thought themſelves ſure of me, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded they had caught a Cully; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they gave me the Beads, which I kiſs'd a thouſand times over, not ſo much for devotion, as the worth of them, which I ſuppoſe was about four or five Piſtols.</p>
                  <p>I went from that place, as if I waited on them, but I had not gone above ſix paces before I ſtopp'd and called the Page I ſpake of, unto me, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ladies that I bid him ſtay there with the reſt of my Attendants, I only asked him if he did not belong to ſuch a Gentlemen, a Couſin of mine? he told me no: The good Ladies thanked me very kindly for the honour I did them,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115509:102"/>and thus we march'd along the ſtreets: Amongſt other diſcourſe, they ask'd me where I lay, and I the better to deceive them, told them at ſuch a Houſe, where there ſtood a Coach as good luck would have it; I alſo aſſur'd them, both the Maſter of the Houſe, and Coach and all were at their command; that my name was <hi>Don Alvaro de Cordoue:</hi> There I left them, and went into the Houſe, they ſtill looking after me; I knew there was a back door belonging to the ſaid Houſe which was ſeldome lock'd, unto which I hy'd me, and ſo got off from my two Ladies, unto my own Quarters.</p>
                  <p>By this it was nightiſh, and the Knights of the Induſtry began to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as I did. I was hardly gotten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Houſe, but in came the Souldier of the ragged Regiment, of whom I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly acquainted you; in he came, I ſay, with a Torch in his hand, which had been given him to carry at a Funeral, but he had come off with it, and never went to the grave; he was called <hi>Magace,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115509:103"/>of <hi>Olias,</hi> he vauted himſelf a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and the truth is, ſuch he had been, as alſo that he had ſeen many hot dayes ſervice againſt the <hi>Moors,</hi> which could not be denied, for he had in Comedy acted a Captains part in a ſtage-play. When he fell into a company who had been in <hi>Flanders,</hi> then he had been in <hi>China,</hi> if he met any who had been in <hi>China,</hi> then all his diſcourſe was of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> He would be always talking of duels, and unſtripping his Doublet in the field, which he had often done, but it was for his more convenient killing his lice, the only foes he ever met. He would prate of the <hi>Turks,</hi> Gallies and Galligroſſes, but it was only what he had read in Ballads, for he never had ſeen ſhip, the Sea, or any thing Sea-like, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a diſh of Pottage with a few Peaſe in it, which he might fancy to be a Fleet in the main Ocean. Once I heard him, talking of the battle of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> and at laſt he ſaid that <hi>Lepanto</hi> was a very ſtout and warlike <hi>Moor.</hi>

                  <p>The next that came in was my Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, his noſe wrapp'd up in his cloak, his eyes like poach'd Eggs; his head in his boſom, his Shoo-rubber all bloody, dropping greaſe and Pottage. We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired where he had been, and whence he came in ſuch diſorder, he told us he had been at the Fathers of the Oratory, and had begg'd a double dole, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be for two poor Gentlemen, who were aſhamed to make known their neceſſities, that he had obtained his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but that others there begging were diſappointed and denied, in regard he had had ſo much for his ſhare; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that they all in a fury, had fallen upon him in a narrow lane, had robb'd him of all his Pottage, excepting thoſe few Remains about his clothes, head, and ſhoulders. He moreover added, how they fell upon him, asking him, if it were well done, to rob poor men for to ſatisfie his own greedy appetite, and how from words they came at laſt to blows and knocks, as alſo what a hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorm
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115509:104"/>of crutches and wooden arms fell upon him, he likewiſe recounted to us how the blow on his noſe came by a great ſpoon, which miſtook the way to his mouth; how that finding himſelf in ſo furious a counter ſcuffle, he had oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en cryed out to them, that he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge to them whatever he had eaten, provided they would forbear beating him, but that to his coſt and ſmart he found them inexorable. And that which vex'd him more then all the reſt; was, how a ragged Tatter-demallion Scholar had, for his ſecond-courſe ſerved up a diſh of Lice, which he threw upon him. Now do but conſider I pray and reflect a little upon this Gut-monger, who is more writhled then a childs baby, look'd juſt like a Ragamuffion, hath more holes in him then a Sive, more ſpotted then a Magpie, and more ſpeckl'd then a piece of Marble, yet forſooth, he muſt eat by himſelf, and could not vouchſafe to do as we did. For my own part I am a Maſter of Arts in <hi>Sigouenca,</hi> and yet I
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115509:104"/>do not ſtand ſo much upon my punctili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o's as he doth. He likewiſe added, how an old raſcal came into the fray, ſaying, knock down that Raſcal, for I would have him know, though I come to the Pottage-Pot of thoſe good Fathers, yet I am as well born as himſelf, and have as good friends as he for his life, nay, I am as good as he every day in the week. He alſo recounted us how the Dole gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeeing the ſtorm began to renew, prevailed ſo far by his entreaties and perſwaſions, that in fine, they were content to be pacified, in regard he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them to provide enough for them all againſt the next day.</p>

                  <p>HE had hardly ended his relation of this notable Encounter, when behold in came one of our Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, with a good Cloak on his back, which he had exchanged for his own, made in 88. at a Billiaad-Table, where he made as if he would play; but having the Induſtry not to make one, he got to the place where the Cloaks lay, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the beſt of them, leaving his own in the ſtead; and upon this account he always frequented bowling-Allies, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115509:105"/>gaming-houſes. This was nothing in compariſon of the next that came in, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a number of children, all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with one diſeaſe or other, as ſome with the Kings-evil, ſome with Tetters, others with Cankers, diſ-jointed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, hurts and the-like: That which drew ſuch a rout after him, was his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to cure and charm all thoſe ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, either by ſaying certain words o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, or by giving them little ſcrowls of Paper to carry about them; by which means he pick'd up a pretty income: in caſe his Patient brought any thing under his Cloak, (as the Country man did the Roſting Pig to the Juſtice of peace) ſome good Capon in his basket, or chink'd his money in his Pocket, then his diſeaſe was nothing, elſe incurable. He made any thing paſs for current amongſt them; for to ſay the truth, he was very induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in lying, a thing ſo natural to him, that he could not ſpeak truth, though it had been to ſave his life: He had a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port would carry him into any place, <hi>viz.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115509:106"/>Deo Gratias,</hi> The Holy Ghoſt be with you; he had always with him the whole Enſignes of an Hypocrite; in his hands a great ſtring of Beads, with a diſcipline under his Coat, which hanged down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his knees, as if by accident, though purpoſely by him intended; his Coatall bloodied, but with that of the Shambles, not of his own: He would feel the Pulſe and pick the Pocket; hold with the Hare and hunt with the Hound; he would make you beleeve his great hunger was but the effects of his voluntary faſtings, though indeed willingly he never went to bed ſupper-leſs, but when he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eat: He never named the Devil, but he always added, God bleſs us; when he entred the Church he kiſs'd the ground he never caſt his eyes on any woman, nor never car'd for any of them, but how to take away their Petticoats; ſo artificially did he gull the people, that every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended himſelf to him in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which ſignified as much as if he had recommended himſelf to the Devil.</p>

                  <p>After him, in came another of the Fraternity, one <hi>Polanque,</hi> keeping a clutter for his Wallet, his great Croſs, his Hermites Beard, and his Bell: His trade was to go thus accoutred at night through the ſtreets, crying, <hi>Amend your lives, think upon your latter ends, and do good unto faithful ſinners;</hi> by this device he got ſtore of money; if in his walk he chanced to find any door open, in he went with a great deal of confidence; if he found no one within, or that they were aſleep, he went not out until he had lin'd himſelf with ſome good thing or other; in caſe he found any one, or that they chanced to wake; he told them how he came in finding the doors open, to adviſe them of it, and that they had need to be careful of night-walkers; and always his Concluſion was with a <hi>Memento Mori.</hi>

                  <p>I paſs'd one Moneth in obſerving the many ways of ſtealing, which were practiced in our ſociety, and at laſt, I related unto them the paſſage of my gold
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115509:107"/>beads, of which I had gull'd my two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of pleaſure; they highly extolled my Induſtrie, and concluded the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould have them to be ſold, and the money brought into the publique Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. At any time when ſhe had any ſuch like things to ſell; ſhe uſed to go from houſe to houſe, ſaying ſhe was a poor neceſſitous woman, forc'd to fell her goods, one thing after another, to buy her bread; when ſhe had hapned upon any compaſſionate people, as ſome ſuch there are, ſhe brought home her own toyes as ſhe ſaid, and ſome of their Alms.

                  <p>WE were no ſooner within, but we were preſently under lock and key; for they laid us all in chains, clap'd Bracelets upon our arms, and lodg'd us in the Dungeon.

                  <p>I forbear to mention the hootings which were made at us as we paſs'd through the ſtreets; the truth is, no one that ſaw us could forbear laughing, for the Serjants and Bayliffs puſh'd us along with ſuch violence that they tore moſt of our clothes, which themſelves were none of the ſtrongeſt; inſomuch that one might have track'd us by the skirts, Arms and raggs which our clothes loſt before we come to <hi>Limbo:</hi> Nay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was no great way from the place we were taken to Priſon, yet ſome of us came thither ſo naked, that a Louſe could hardly faſten any hold upon us without diſcovery.</p>

                  <p>Night came, and I was lodged in a great Hall, vulgarly called the common Priſon. I was ſomewhat ſurpriſed to ſee ſo many ſtrange faces there, ſome lay in their fur'd Gowns, others ſang, ſome played, and others walkt up and down, until at laſt one came who put out the Candle and made faſt the door upon us.</p>
                  <p>For my part it was impoſſible for me to ſleep amidſt ſuch a confuſed din, and that which vexed me worſt of all, was, a cloſe-ſtool which ſtood juſt at my beds head, where every one came to make his offerings, and to deliver his Priſoner, which upon their eſcape made ſo hideous a noiſe, that at firſt I took it to have bin ſome thunderclaps, until my noſe had better inform'd me of the truth of the matter: I was vexed with the horrible ſtench of it, that unable longer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, or keep my head within the bed I roſe, took up the ſtool-pan and threw it with a pox into the midſt of the Hall, that every one might have a little of it as
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115509:109"/>well as my ſelf: Some of the company, whoſe noſes were daintier then the reſt; got them up, and began to cry out that they were choked up with the ſtink, that he who had done this wicked prank deſerv'd to be hang'd: At this noiſe the head Goaler awak'd, and miſtruſting leaſt ſome of his Priſoners had eſcaped, ran into the Hall with all his Attendants arm'd: He had us all into examination, I was chiefly, nor was I backward in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing my ſelf the beſt I could: To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the good Goaler thinking, belike, I would greaſe him in the fiſt with t' other odd Crown, that I might be delivered from the Kennel of ſuch Hounds, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to riſe and follow him, which I inſtantly did, but with a firm reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not to part with one farthing more: Away I went with him, and was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er got out of the Hall, but that he began to threaten me with a Dungeon, full of Snails, Froggs and Toads; I muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, ſaid I, he ſeeing I ſpake not in a golden phraſe, lock'd me up in the ſame
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115509:110"/>hole with the reſt of my unfortunate, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Brothers, there I paſs'd the reſt of the night, without knowing who my Chamber-fellows were.</p>
                  <p>At laſt day appeared, we viſited each other, renewed our acquaintance, and deplored our conditions; not long after came one to let us out, for that place was only our night Quarters; he demanded a clenſing-fee, under penalty of Eel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins: I could not imagine what he meant by that tearm of Art, but was afraid leaſt the Eels ſhould devour us; but I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed they were certain waſters, or great blows about the middle, which were applied with a reverſe ſlaſh on ſuch as were backward in opening their Purſes: I muſt confeſs my own weakneſs, for to ſay the truth, I preſently drew out ſix Royals and gave them to him, whereas my poor companions having no money, were forced back again.</p>
                  <p>There was in the ſame Lodging with us a certain huge over-grown Lubber, with a Beard as big as a ſix penny beſome,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115509:110"/>and a pair of ſhoulders, which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts had lately been ſcarrified by the Doctors hands who uſeth to cure all diſeaſes in publique. Never did I in my life ſee ſuch Bracelets, as he had on his legs and arms, either for length big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or number. He was called the Giant, he told us, he was in for a trivial windy matter, which he valued not, I ſuppoſed then, that he was in for ſome Bellowes, Bag-pipes, Foot-balls Fans, or the like; but when we asked him if it were for any thing of that nature, he told us, not, but for ſome poſt-dated ſins. I thought then he had been a <hi>Long-lane</hi> Merchant, and had ſold old for new clothes, but at length after much enquiry, I diſcover'd he had been in love with the maſculine Gender. He was a fellow both terrible and furious, inſomuch that the Goaler was fain to arm all thoſe who lay neer him with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Breeches, and had he not been well chain'd, no body durſt let a foiſt or fart before him, for fear of putting him in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115509:111"/>mind of the Region of Buttocks. He was accompanied with another, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt a man as himſelf, who ſaid he was in for being too dexterous, and for catching of fiſh without wetting his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. I enquired a little more curiouſly into his meaning, and found he was ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what light-finger'd, and that nothing could ſcape him. I was likewiſe told, how there was hardly a Poſt-horſe in the Kingdom which had been ſo ſlaſh'd as he had been; for he had paſs'd through all the Beadles hands; you could not ſpeak of his ears in the plural number, and for his face a man would have thought it had been inlay'd with new fleſh, there were ſuch great Seames in it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides thoſe two, there were four others, whom the Juſtice had repriv'd from the Gallows and condemn'd to the Gallies: I heard them ſay, how in a few dayes they hoped they might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to brag, that they had ſerv'd his Majeſty both by Sea and Land. Theſe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115509:111"/>good honeſt people were much diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with my poor Comerades, for that they had not given ſome clenſing money, as I had; and thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded among themſelves to beſtow the Eelskins upon them with a vengeance, tuff cord which they had provided for that purpoſe. Night came, and we were lock'd up in our old Quarter, it was not long ere the Candle was put out, and I preſently began to ſmell their plot, whereupon I got me under the ſtair-caſe, and could have crept into an Auger-hole, ſo ſhin I was for fear. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently one of the gang fell a whiſtling, and another to manage his whip: My Brothers of the Induſtry ſoon perceiv'd the meaning of it, and got them as cloſe one to another, as their skins was to their fleſh. The whip in the mean time went on very cheerfully, without putting any body to the ſqueak. But thoſe cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Rogues hearing no body cry out, began to throw about certain ſtones and Tyles which they had kept in reſerve for
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115509:112"/>that end, one of which made an inciſion in poor <hi>Don Torrivio</hi>'s Crupper, at leaſt two fingers broad, thereupon he fell à roaring, as if he had been kill'd, and thoſe wicked ungratious Varlets fell to ſinging and ſhaking their chains as lowd as they could, to prevent the hearing of <hi>Don Torrivio</hi>'s out-cry, who to ſave himſelf pull'd the others upon him, and each endeavouring to get undermoſt, one might have heard their bones crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle like a Lazers bell. In this ſcuffle, all to pieces went their cloathes; nor did the ſhower of ſtones and Tiles ceaſe for all that, inſomuch that poor <hi>Don Torrivio</hi> who lay expoſed to the whole volly of ſhot, ſeeing himſelf at death's door, ready to dye a Martyr, though he had neither goodneſs nor holineſs, cryed out, that he would pay their fee, ſo they would let him come out and be at quiet; to which end he would depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite his clothes in their hands, adding he had rather keep his bed for want of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes then health. All of them would
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115509:112"/>needs be admitted into the ſame Articles, but maugre all their Induſtry, their heads were firſt as ſoft as ſo many rotten Apples, with the hail-ſtorm which fell upon them. But at laſt, a ceſſation was concluded for that night. It was not long ere day appeared, and a Summons delivered for performance of Articles, but when they came to the execution of them, they found that all their clothes would hardly make one good pair of Socks: However they were all ſeiz'd into cuſtody, not ſo much for their worth, as to leave their Maſters naked, that they might put a new trick upon them.</p>
                  <p>They were quickly uncaſed, not ſo much left them as a rag to cover their nakedneſs, beſides one old rugg, and then it was that they began to be ſenſible of a moſt terrible Itch; for to compleat their miſeries, the Goaler laid them juſt where all the rabble of the Priſoners u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to louze themſelves, long they had not been there, before the merry lowſe
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115509:113"/>ſeiz'd on them, who having been kept long faſting, would in a few hours have made a break-faſt of my poor Brothers, had they not quickly thrown away their Coverlet, and ſo covered their bellies with their Bums.</p>
                  <p>For my part I got me out of this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and beſeech'd them to have me excuſed, if I took my leave of them, for that my preſence might well be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they having no want of company. I made new applications to the Goaler, and tickl'd him in the Palm with a little more of St. <hi>John</hi>'s greaſe, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my former reſolution; he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me with the Attornies name, in whoſe hands our Informations and proceſs were, I ſent a little Boy who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Priſon for him, he came, we withdrew apart to conſider of my getting off. At firſt he was upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, but when I told him, I knew how to be grateful, and would deſerve any good office he ſhould do me, he look'd as brisk as a glaſs of Canary, and became
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115509:113"/>as pliant as a Does-leather glove. I convey'd a brace of Piſtols into his hands and deſired him to befriend me, as much as that came to. I told him, I was a young Knight, not acquainted with the world, &amp;c. Sir ſaid he it's enough, I underſtand you, look you Sir the good or ill ſucceſs of a buſineſs is in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, many are the diſorders which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen when our offices are conferr'd upon ſuch men, as have not the honour or conſcience to do the work as I do. Il'e undertake the buſineſs, fear nothing. The Judges may prate and talk their pleaſures upon the bench, but when it comes to the execution, we do as we pleaſe, but what need I tell you any more? fear nothing, truſt to me. He bid me farwell, and went to the door, but preſently came back to me; I have a word more to tell you, quoth he, with a ſowr look: There is a ſort of Twatlers who will be prating, unleſs you lock up their mouths under a ſilver ſeal. If you gratifie the Serjeant, it were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115509:114"/>for look you Sir, he may elſe do you a miſchief, by putting out a word which might ſpoil all. Sir ſaid I, will you be pleaſed to preſent him with this Piſtoll in my behalf, for that I am not acquainted with him. He took it and promiſed to do it that day, and withall told me, I ſhould do well to ſet my col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar right, which then ſtood towards the Ale-houſe, that I ſhould get ſome Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenges for my cough, which I had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by lying in the cold, and then away he went: Not long after I gave the Goaler half a Piſtol, who thereupon eas'd me of my chains, and permitted me to eat and drink with him, though the ſauce coſt me full dearly.</p>
                  <p>After ſome few dayes paſs'd, our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was concluded and preſented to the Judges to be ſign'd.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115509:115"/>good humour; ſhe liſped a little, but it became her mighty well, very fearful ſhe was of a Mouſe, had a lilly-white hand, of which ſhe was not a little proud, and would ever and anone be putting it up to her forehead as if it itch'd, purpoſely that ſhe might ſhew it: At Table ſhe carv'd all the meat; it company ſhe would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten take off her Gloves, either to faſten or take our ſome Pin or other; if ſhe play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Tables, or ſhuffle-board, becauſe ſhe might not want occaſions to ſhew her fair hands; ſhe would often pretend to yawn, that her teeth might be ſeen, and then with her bare hand would ſhe make the ſign of the Croſs over her mouth, and to the ſame end would ſhe often laugh.</p>
                  <p>I was kindly entertained by them they lodg'd me in the ſame Chamber with two other Gueſts, one a Portugal, t' other a Catalonian. At my firſt coming I caſt my eyes upon the young Girle, who me thoughts would ſerve my turn to paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the time, nor did the conqueſt of her appear very difficult, for that we were
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115509:115"/>both in the ſame houſe: I told her mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtories which I had read, and ſome I made to paſs away the time: In a word, I was very officious to do her ſervice. Now becauſe <hi>Annetta,</hi> ſuch was her name, was very curious and inquiſitive; I made her believe I was a Conjurer, and that I could do ſtrange feats; that I could make the houſe ſink under ground in her apprehenſion, and preſently ſeem as if it were on fire; that I could make people dance naked, or fight with one another, if I pleaſed, with a thouſand ſuch like crotchical devices, all which the poor ſoul ſwallowed for truth. By theſe devices, together with ſome ſmall liberalities ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in Collations, and ſuch other Knacks as I preſented to her, I became intimately acquainted, and had ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated my ſelf into the favour, both of <hi>Annetta</hi> and her Mother; not but that I intended to make up my Markets again upon what I could take, after I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained my ends on her.</p>
                  <p>The Portugal, of whom I told you,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115509:116"/>was ready to die for love of <hi>Annetta,</hi> he never came neer her but he ſighed like a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> at a long Lecture; He was much given to muſing, melancholy, and the like, and withal, as convetous as a Lawer; he drank by himſelf, and faſted every three days; nay, his Bread was ſo hard, that the teeth of a Saw could hardly enter it: He would ever and anon be crowing of his valor, but had he laid eggs, he had been a moſt perfect Hen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for he troubled all people with his cakling; yet he was not ſo blind as not to perceive how I had got the ſtart of him in <hi>Annettas</hi> good will: Now to put a rub in my way, he would ſometimes rail on me, and call me louſie beggarly Knave, and low minded Raſcal; I was made acquainted with it, and ſometimes heard it with my own ears, but took no notice of it, rather humoured him, and collogu'd with him, leaſt ſome miſchief might have hapned in caſe we ſhould have quarrel'd with one another, which poſſible might have forc'd one, if not both of us, to leave
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115509:116"/>the Lodging, by which means I might come to looſe not only my expectations, but likewiſe all the expence I had been at in courting <hi>Annetta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while, I loſt no time of improving that good eſteem I had gotten with <hi>Annetta;</hi> in ſo much that in a little time I had contracted ſo great a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with her, that ſhe permitted me to write unto her the ſtories of my love, which I always delivered with my own hands: She was much taken with my Letters and Love-ſongs, a diſh ſhe had ſeldom taſted, being notes of the higheſt quality, and was raviſhed with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and honours I had done her. My Letters uſually began with theſe or the like expreſſions. <hi>I have preſumed: Your extraordinary Beauty: The flames which conſume me: Thoſe Suns of your eyes;</hi> the end always full of ſubmiſſions, ſuch as in thoſe caſes are uſual: I ſubſcribed my ſelf, <hi>The ſervant of her ſervants: The vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of her diſdain: The ſubject of her power:</hi> By theſe and the like ways we became in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115509:117"/>fine ſo intimatè that we always ſpoke to one another in the Quakers terms, <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, notwithſtanding all theſe Freedoms, I could never get her to do feat: but at laſt feeing ſhe was as ambitious as crafty, I told her one day with a great deal of confidence, that I had learnt a ſecret in Magick to make one be beloved of any perſon he had a mind to; and that I had ſo great a paſſion for her advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fortune; that I would teach it her, in caſe ſhe would gratifie me with ſome favour: At this ſhe began to prick up her ears, yet ſhe was ſubtle enough not to let her ſelf be ſnap'd by men; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence would you have, ſaid ſhe ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? I ſhould think the ſmaleſt favour thrown away, if I ſhould venture it upon ſuch ſlender hopes; but in caſe you let me firſt ſee any of your rarities, I ſhall then know how to proportion my grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. I was not diſmayed, rather over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed at this reply, for a Fort which ſo capitulateth is half ſurrendred: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115509:117"/>I promiſed to content her the firſt opportunity ſhe could procure of a little privacie and leiſure: The great deſire ſhe had of ſeeing me do what I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, made her reſolve upon the night following: An hour after midnight, ſaid ſhe, all the houſe will be faſt a ſleep, and then we may ſecurely meet at my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber window; for ſaid ſhe, in caſe you be ſo skilful, you may eaſily find a way to come through the Gallery into my Chamber by the window; That I can, ſaid I, as eaſily as ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>I was exceedingly deſireous of trying my deſtiny, in order whereunto I got me into the Gallery at the appointed hour; but as the Devil would have it, I no ſooner ſet my ſelf to ſlide down out of the Gallery upon her window, but my foot ſlip'd, and I fel upon a houſe juſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ours, which belonged to an Attorney, one who was no very good friend of my Landlords: My fall was very great, ſo great that it broke above twenty tiles, which left many remembrances in my
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115509:118"/>ſides; the noiſe of my fall wakened a ſleeping Lyon, as the Proverb ſaith, for ſuch I found it, to my grief: The Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer cryed out amain, Thieves, Thieves, and preſently came up to to the houſe top with a Brother of his, and two young Clerks; I no ſooner ſpied them but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to hide my ſelf behind a Chimney, not far from me, but to little purpoſe God wot, for they fell on me like a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derclap, in ſo much that I thought that minute would have been my laſt: The next thing they did was to bind me, nor would they admit of any excuſe. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netta</hi> beheld all theſe paſſages, but ſhe was ſo poſſeſſed with what I had told her, that ſhe thought they had been ſo many illuſions, only to make her laugh, ſo that ſhe continued ſaying it's enough it's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                  <p>I told them I lodg'd in the next houſe, the Maſter whereof could aſſure them I was not ſuch a man as they took me to be, but they laughed at me: To conclude, they caſt me into a Cellar, amongſt a
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115509:118"/>number of Faggots, there lay I till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though it were almoſt day when my misfortune befell me, it being in the Summer time, and about two hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter midnight.</p>

                  <p>Day being come, my Lawyer cauſed
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115509:119"/>me to be brought before him, he began to examine me, and to reprehend me for being a Thief, in which he was very elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, for to ſay the truth, he was his Crafts-maſter at that feat.</p>
                  <p>When behold <hi>Annetta</hi> by this time, ſuſpecting belike the power of my Charms, had acquainted her Father and Mother with the miſhap, making them beleeve that I was ſhewing ſome feats of activity before her in the Gallery, and by miſchance had fallen out of the window upon the next houſe, where they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me for a Lurcher, and not a Tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler: She entreated the Catalonian and Portugal to ſpeak in my behalf, and to inform our Lawyer of my honeſty and behaviour; they were no ſooner come unto the Lawyer but he began to look about him, ſuſpecting them to be parties and complices of my ſuppoſed theft. The Portugal was highly incenſed againſt him for it, and began to give him ill Language, told him that for his own part he was a Gentleman belonging to the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115509:120"/>Kings Family, and that I was a Perſon of Honour, that he wronged himſelf to believe I was a Robber, and withal, came preſently to unbind me: My Clerk ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf alone, began to cry out for more help, but to little purpoſe, for I was ſet at liberty in ſpite of his teeth. The Lawyer ſeeing things carried by a high hand, was forced to be content, but told us, this our undue violence might coſt us full dear, but when he ſaw us going, at leaſt, quoth he, give me ſomething for the tiles you have broken; I underſtood his meaning, and preſented him with eight Royals: I was indeed at that time in ſo liberal a humour, that I could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have found in my heart to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid him with intereſt, thoſe many blows he had lent me the night before; but that no body might take notice of any ſuch thing, I carryed them all quietly away upon my ſhoulders, and gave many thanks unto my two friends who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed me from my Captivity.</p>
                  <p>Being come back to our Quarters, the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115509:120"/>Catalonian could not forbear playing upon me, ſometimes he would be asking me what price Faggots did bear, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles that cleanlineſs was a very recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable quality in a man; that bruſhing ones clothes would preſerve them much the longer and handſomer: In ſo much that at laſt I found my ſelf on the one ſide much troubled at his jeers, and yet on the other ſide very much oblig'd to him for his aſſiſtance: Unable then to ſatisfie both theſe my reſentments, I reſolved to find out ſome medium between theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, <hi>viz.</hi> to Eclipſe my ſelf, that is, to withdraw my ſelf from my Lodging; but ſo as I might eſcape paying the reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning I owed there, which was none of the leaſt: There was only one thing in my way, my Cloak-bag, which could hardly be carried out unperceiv'd; well, I made a Scholar, a notable Crack, and one of my acquaintance in <hi>Alcala,</hi> privy to my deſign, who with two other of his friends, and their two ſervants, brought a cloſe Chair one night unto the Lodging

                  <p>BEhold me now out of the Attorneys Clutches, and <hi>Annettas</hi> fair hands; but withal I found my ſelf in a ſad, weak condition, for I could hardly ſtand alone for want of ſtrength, ever ſince my fall,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115509:122"/>and thoſe blows the Lawyer beſtowed upon me: I was therefore of neceſſity to take ſome reſt; for the better effecting whereof, I took a Lodging at the further end of the City, where I light upon a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good woman, who made me kindly welcome: At firſt coming I put a good face upon it, for had I told her I was not well, ſhe would hardly have receiv'd me into her houſe: There I lay ſick about a Moneth, which coſt me neer hand all that little which was left me of my ſmall fortune. At laſt I began to pick up my crumbs, when upon a certain morning, about ſix a clock, juſt as I wakned out of a dream, in which me thought I was dead, I beheld my Landlady ſtanding at my beds head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which wanted little of putting me into a ſwoon; for to ſay the truth, I took her to be death it ſelf: She was a wrizl'd old woman, about three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years old; her face like a tan'd hide, and as full of chops as a parch'd field in a hot Summer; ſhe ever carried a ſtring of Beads in her hand, over which ſhe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115509:122"/>would pur juſt like a Cat when ſhe is made much of; ſhe was a woman of great repute in that Quarter, and had the name of doing many good offices amongſt her neighbours, and indeed ſhe had more good qualities then one; ſometimes ſhe would be making of Matches; other times ſhe would play the Bawd, and anon lend money upon pawns; her houſe was never without company; ſhe was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at teaching of young Girles, who were ſetting up of themſelves, how they ſhould wear their Hoods, and what part of their face they might ſhew for the moſt advantage; ſuch as had good white teeth ſhe would adviſe to be ever ſmiling, nay and to ſhew them, though they were weeping: Thoſe who had fine hands ſhe would counſel to be ever and anon play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Fans, to the end the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the one might ſet off the cleerneſs of t'other, to take off their Gloves every other turn, and to put them on again; ſuch as had good handſome Hair, ſhe would inſtruct how to wear it to the moſt
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115509:123"/>advantage; and ſhe would read a Lecture how the eyes ought to be turn'd, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their greatneſs or ſmallneſs. As for matter of Painting, ſhe was excellent at it; ſhe could make one though as black as a Crow, ſeem ſo fair, that her own Husband ſhould hardly know her; But her Maſter-piece was to retrive a loſt Maiden-head, and ſo to ſodder it up, as the leaſt crack ſhould not appear.</p>
                  <p>In leſs then eight days that I was with her, I ſaw her uſe all theſe Arts: Beſides all which ſhe taught her Pupils how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate themſelves into a Gentlemans Jewel or Ring. The young ones between juſt and earneſt; the eldeſt ſort by way of favour, and the old ones in the nature of a reward; ſhe read Lectures of the true asking of money, toyes, and the like.</p>
                  <p>I have inſerted theſe particulars, the more to move your pity, when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider into what hands I was fallen; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that you may readily apprehend the propoſals ſhe was about to make unto
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115509:123"/>me, which thus began, for ſhe always ſpoke in Parables and Proverbs.</p>
                  <p>Son alwayes taking out, and never putting in, will empty the greateſt diſh in <hi>Europe,</hi> Like duſt, like dirt, like man, like match. I know thee not, nor what Religion thou art of. Young thou art, and therefore no wonder that thou art given to roguery, without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that thy life wears out, whileſt thou ſleepeſt. I have more years upon my head of the two, and conſequently can give thee ſome good Inſtructions, but why ſhould I? I have been told thou haſt ſpent ſtore of money in a thouſand trifles; that ſometimes thou art a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, otherwhiles a Begger, and anon a Gentleman, ſometimes a man, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhiles a Mouſe, Oh child, tell me with whom thou haſt lived, and Il'e tell thee of what humour thou art. Like to like. I would have thee to know, many times the toaſt is loſt between the cup and lip. Ah Varlet as thou art, If thou lov'dſt a wench, where was I?
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115509:124"/>didſt thou not know me? wert thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with my abilities? I dare ſwear thou haſt been with ſome pitiful Grooms wife or other; for my part I meddle with no ſuch Cattle, no faith, mine are all with black Hoods, and Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-Smocks. Hadſt thou come to me, I'de have ſaved thee a good many Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols, which thou haſt thrown away idlely, it ſhould have coſt thee nothing. It is not money I value, nor would I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ask thee for one peny on that thou oweſt me for lodging, had I not occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to buy ſome Candle and Sallets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt night.</p>
                  <p>With that ſhe ended her diſcourſe, and I perceived all this beating of the Buſh, was to get the money I owed her for my Lodging, which I paid unto her, and told her I ſhould be very ſorry that my forgetfulneſs ſhould be the occaſion of hindring any her affairs. Whileſt I was counting out her money, my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes which were never unmindful of me, and the Divel who never forgot
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115509:124"/>me, conſpired together to undo me once more, for the Conſtable had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd that ſhe kept an ugly rogue then in the houſe, who lay with her, upon which accompt he came to lay hands on her. Now I pray do but conſider how things fell out, They came directly up ſtaires into my chamber, and finding me in my bed, and her at my Bolſter, they concluded me to be the Gallant for whom they ſearch'd. Preſently they ſeized on me, drew me out of bed, and dragg'd me up and down the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for I could not yet ſtand upon my legs. In the mean while two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, took my poor Landlady to task, whom they kick'd and called a thouſand Whores, Witches and Bawds.</p>
                  <p>With the noiſe of the Conſtable his men, my Land-lady and ſelf, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubus of our Succubus awaked, and hearing me cry out, that they miſtook me for another, who lay in the next Chamber, thought himſelf to be the man they ſought for, whereupon he
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115509:125"/>preſently got up, and contriving how to make ſure of one, got down ſtaires, and intended to get out at the back door, but one of the Officers had ſpied him, and got hold of him. Thereupon up they came to me, and deſired me to pardon their miſtake, which I did very willingly, to be rid of them. Away they carried my Land-lady and her Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant to Priſon, and left me where they found me. I continued eight dayes longer in the ſame houſe, under the Barbers hands unable to go without crutches, and that which was worſt of all, I had not one croſs left wherewithal to bleſs my ſelf, for thoſe ſhaving Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons had ſuck'd up my laſt hundred Royals, to ſet me upon my legs again. In this ſtreight I was forc'd to go abroad for fear of being famiſh'd, but how think you? with my two crutches to beg for my living. But firſt I ſold my clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes which were indifferent good, and with the money bought me a leathern Colar, a Canvas Doublet, and an old
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115509:125"/>patch'd Gown. Then I got me ſome leather bags for my legs, which I warp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in a great many old rags: Thus accoutred, with a great braſs Croſs hanging at my neck, and a moſt invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible ſtring of Beads in my hands, I went abroad to ſeek my fortune: The reſidue of my money I ſowed up in my Doublet. I counterfeited my voice for that of a diſtreſſed Soul, who would move the world to pity him, and thus I began to manage the wallet which ſometimes brings a pretty income with it, if duely underſtood. I got ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary words in my begging, <hi>Good Chriſtian people,</hi> would I ſay, <hi>Servants of the Lord, Pity a poor diſtreſſed body afflicted with ſickneſs and ſores, who bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his griefs with patience.</hi> This was my Dialect on working dayes, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Holy-dayes I was in another Cue. <hi>Faith without Charity is dead, you Souls devoted to God, who is perfect Charity it ſelf,</hi> would I ſay, <hi>and for the Virgin</hi> Maries <hi>ſake, that bleſsed Queen of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115509:126"/>have compaſſion upon a poor Cripple, whom the Lord hath touched with his hand.</hi> Then fetching a great ſigh, I would make a ſtop, and I aſſure you, that is a main thing. Ha! would I ſay, <hi>It hath pleaſed God to make me as you ſee me, though not long ſince I wrought for my living, and was as healthy as any of you, but praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be the Lord.</hi> By this <hi>Induſtry</hi> the pence and farthings would ſometimes fall like a hail-ſtorm into an old hat, which I held to receive alms. Then did I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to repent, I had no ſooner betaken my ſelf to that trade. It was not long ere I had contracted an acquaintance with another old Beggar, with whom I lodged, as notable a fellow at our ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as any one in the whole world, for I perſwade my ſelf he was a Doctor at that and all other Rogueries: He had an artificial Rupture, as big as a nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin Bowl: He tyed one of his arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his ſhoulder with a good ſtrong Cord, ſo that his hand would preſently appear all ſwollen and inflam'd. He
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115509:126"/>would lye on the ground, and letting his pretended rupture appear out of his breeches, lay his hand on a little pillow and then cry in a lamentable tone, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider good Chriſtians, how it hath pleaſed the Lord of his mercy to viſit me with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Infirmities.</hi> If any woman paſs'd by him, <hi>God keep you fair Miſtreſs</hi> would he ſay: Some there were ſo fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh of that ſex, as that they would choſe to go by the Street where he was, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to be called fair, though they had no buſineſs that way. If any Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Maſter paſs'd by him, he called him Captain; if of any other condition, either Eſquires, worſhipful Knight, or Lord; if any Eccleſiaſtical man paſs'd neer him, he preſently had him by the ear with a good Maſter <hi>Abbot;</hi> in a word, he diſpatched letters Patents for Titles of honour, at a ſmall rate to the buyer, and at no great trouble to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not but that he got well enough by it.</p>
                  <p>In leſs then ſix weeks I had pick'd up

I bought me a gray ſuite with a Sword, and ſo bid Adieu to my fellow Beggers; for the truth is, I was a little too ſtout to ſtoop unto that beggerly profeſſion, and thus I departed toward <hi>Toledo.</hi>

                  <p>THe firſt Stage I went, it was my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to light upon a company of Players going for <hi>Toledo;</hi> they had three Coaches with them, and amongſt the reſt one who had been of my acquaintance whilſt I was at <hi>Alcala,</hi> but had now left his ſtudie to go to Play:
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115509:128"/>Him I acquainted with my reſolution of leaving the Court and going to <hi>Toledo:</hi> he no ſooner heard me ſay ſo, but he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced me very kindly, and ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with his friends, that they gave me leave to make one of their company. When all was ready to ſet forth, they call'd on me to pay my part of the horſe hire, by which means I got into one of the Coaches: They went higlety piglety all together, men and women, amongſt whom there was one very handſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who danced exceeding well, and acted the Queen and Princeſſes in all their Comedies. Now as good luck would have it, it was my hap to ſit next unto her Husband; and not knowing unto whom I ſpake, but tranſported by my paſſion, or bewitched by her looks; do you know ſaid I unto him, how a man might buy yon Merchandiſe, or at leaſt how he might adventure a twenty Crowns upon her, for me thinks ſhe is very handſome: It would not very well become me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, to be your Schoolmaſter in that
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115509:128"/>particular, for that I am her Husband; but this I may tell you, your money would not be ill imployed; for to ſpeak without paſſion, I can aſſure you the world hath not a more delicate ſofter piece of fleſh then her ſelf, or one of a more gameſome, toying humour; and withal, went out of that Coach into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, belike to give me opportunity to ſpeak unto her: For my part I was much taken with the paſſage, which me thoughts was a very good one, and made appear that he ſpake truth, when he ſpake thoſe words without paſſion: Being deſirous then to make uſe of the opportunity I then had; I got me cloſe to her, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted her in the beſt Language I could: She enquired what I was, and whether I went; in fine, we underſtood each other, but defer'd all until we came unto <hi>Toledo,</hi> for our better conveniencie. We paſſed away the time very cheerily; amongſt other diſcourſe I began to recite a certain piece of a Play, which I had acted when a Boy; it was a part of St <hi>Alexis,</hi> for
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115509:129"/>you muſt know, the Spaniards are ſuch good Catholiques that moſt of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are Religious. It ſeems I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed it with ſo good an action, that they asked me the queſtion whether I would be one of them; and to egg me on, told me many things in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their profeſſion. The truth is, I had already a great mind to the young woman; nor could I forbear ſcratching where it itch'd not, whereupon I ingaged to ſtay with them two years; Our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Articles were drawn up, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted; I had my habits and ſpeeches delivered unto me, and at laſt unto <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo</hi> we came, where in a ſhort time I made my ſelf famous for one of the moſt able men of the Theater.</p>
                  <p>We adventur'd upon a Comedie made by one of our own Tribe: Now you muſt know, I being but a Novice began to wonder when I ſaw a Stage player, and a Poet both one and the ſame perſon; for I ſuppoſed none but men of Parts and Abilities had undertaken that profeſſion;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115509:129"/>but the longer I liv'd the more I learnt, for at laſt I perceived that moſt of the Actors were all Compoſers: The time is well chang'd, thought I to my ſelf, for I remember when no one but that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Lopo de Vega,</hi> durſt undertake to write one: Well, we adventured as I told you upon our Comedy, which was but ill contrived and worſe acted, in ſo much that the Auditors were very much diſcontented.</p>
                  <p>The next day our Compoſer ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he had then well mended the matter, ingaged us to act it a ſecond time: we did ſo; As God would have it it began with a War, and I came upon the Stage-arm'd with a Head-piece, Back and Breaſt, with a Truncheon in my hand, without which I am confident I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come off a live, the ſtones and Cudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els did ſo clutter about my ears; never was there ſuch a ſtorm ſeen or heard: The truth is, the Comedy deſerv'd it, for it chang'd a <hi>Norman</hi> King into a <hi>Hermite,</hi> without Rhime or Reaſon, head or tail;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115509:130"/>Then for an Interlude it brought in two footmen; and at laſt to cloſe up all the Intricacies, it ended in a general Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Sure I am we were well paid for our pains, and ſome of us began to grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at our Poet: We laid before him the danger unto which he expoſed us, and the like, unto which he replied ſaying, for his part we need not fall out with him for there was not any thing of his in the whole Comedy, but only the placing of ſeveral Speeches together, out of divers Plays, which he had in a Book bound up together, like a Cloak piec'd up of ſeveral raggs; and that the misfortune was, they were not well ſewed together: He confeſſed one day unto me, That all Comedians, meaning Compoſers, were under the Statute of Reſtitution, for that they ſtole all they did: The truth is, I was much taken with the conceit, and reſolv'd to try how I could make one hang together by the ſame Art: For to ſay the truth, I always found my ſelf inclined to Poetry: I was acquainted
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115509:130"/>with ſome, and had read others, as <hi>Garcilaſſo</hi> and the like. To be ſhort, I fell to it, and what with the money I got and what paſtime I had with the Players Wife, of whom I told you: I lived ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry merrily, nor did we ever fall into any more ſuch praemunires, for we began to take up and correct our former abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and made Plays indeed, by which I got for my own ſhare no ſmall applauſe, and which pleas'd me better, no little ſum of money.</p>
                  <p>We had not been a full moneth in <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi> before I had gotten three very good Suits of clothes on my back; nay, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo famous, that ſome other ſets of our own profeſſion would fain have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted me to come over to them: I was already Prompter; I corrected their Action and Cadence: I was the only man that gave direction for the dreſſing or ſetting out the Stage. If any one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a new Comedy to be acted, it was preſently brought to my examination, in ſo much that many days had not paſſed
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115509:131"/>before I grew very conceited of my own worth, and began to patch up old ends together; ſo that in ſhort I became an abſolute Poet, and had the confidence, I mean, Impudence, to make a Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which ſo added to my former credit, that I wanted hands enough to write ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo plagued I was with a company of amorous fools, that haunted me day and night, to acquaint me with the ſtate of their Loves, and to intreat me to make Copies of Verſes for them; ſome upon abſence, others upon diſdain; ſome upon jealouſie, and the like, according to their ſeveral paſſions. Now I had a ſet price upon all my pieces, though the truth is I afforded them good cheap, for the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſale of them: Now as I was one day very hard at making of a Comedy, there befell me one of the pleaſanteſt things that I think was ever heard of: And thus it was, for though it redound to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, yet I will not be aſhamed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with it: You muſt know, that when the Poetick fury came upon me, I
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115509:131"/>had gotten ſuch a trick that I could not forbear walking up and down the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with the ſame earneſtneſs, and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my Verſes with the ſame loudneſs, as if I had been upon the Stage. Now it ſo fell out, that a Maid in the houſe where I Lodged, was coming up to my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber juſt about noon with my Dinner, which was of two diſhes, one of Broth, another of Roſt-meat, at which time I was by chance upon a deſcription of the hunting of wild beaſts, and of a man pull'd down by a Bear, and as if it had been my own ſelf, I began to cry out in a pitiful tone,
<q>
                        <l>Save thy ſelf from this ſame Bear,</l>
                        <l>Leaſt that thy body he ſhould tare.</l>
                        <l>Oh! how my Limbs are rent in ſunder?</l>
                        <l>Now he hath got my body under.</l>
                        <l>Save thy ſelf, for now I ſee</l>
                        <l>He is reſolv'd to fall on thee.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The poor Wench was ſo terrified with my cry and action, that ſhe verily belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved I had really adviſed her to ſave her
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115509:132"/>ſelf leaſt ſhe were devoured: The great haſt in which ſhe was to be gon, made her leap down all the ſtairs at once; down ſhe came, and the diſhes upon her; away ſhe got into the ſtreet, crying there was a Bear in the houſe, killing and eating a man: I heard the noiſe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending whence it came, went out that I might diſ-abuſe the poor Girle: But notwithſtanding all my haſte, I found about a dozen men at the door, ſome with Spits, ſome with Halberts, and others with Swords, ſwearing and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, who ask'd me where the Bear was? Thereupon I up and told them the whole ſtory, and repeated the Verſes which had occaſioned that Alarm: Oh! how mad and vexed they were? ſo that what with ſhame, and what with anger, they curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Poetry and Poet too, unto the pit of Hell; but that little troubled me, that which concern'd me moſt, was, I was forc'd to faſt that day for want of a Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to ſay Grace after meal before I had eaten a bit of any thing.</p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:115509:132"/>
                  <p>My companions hearing of this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, intended to make a Song of it, and all the Town did ring again, both of this and ſome other misfortunes which befell me whileſt I made profeſſion of Poetry.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, another accident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tided us, which reflected on all the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual members of our fraternity, in as much as it ſtruck at our very head. The Maſter of our Company had ran in debt with ſome Long-lane Merchants, for old Clothes, and ſuch like neceſſaries of our uſe, but they perceiving no ſigne of money, arreſted him, laid him up in ſafe cuſtody; whereupon, all the reſt of his Creditors came in thick and threefold upon him, by which means he lay under ſo many locks and keys, that there was little likelihood of his ever getting out: By this means our ſociety began to moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der away, and each one ſhifted for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: The truth is, there were others enough who would have been glad to have drawn me to them, but I had no great mind to the Trade, having inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115509:133"/>friendſhip with him, who had firſt introduc'd me into the ſociety of my Stage-Players; his name was <hi>Aliſtor,</hi> a man both of courage and diſcretion. We two laid our heads together, and reſolved to travel the Countrey, and to ſee <hi>Seville,</hi> upon deſign of changing our garb; being once got thither, and to bear it out like Gentlemen indeed, that we might the more freely frequent Ordinaries and gaming houſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently make uſe of our skill in dice and cards, we bought us a brace of very good mules, and came to <hi>Seville</hi> very happily. In all our journey we ſpent not one peny of our main ſtock, for we had light upon ſome youngſters, whom we fleec'd ſo well, that their monies paid our reckonings. We had not been long there, ere we ſold our Mules with their appurtenances, and put our ſelves into our intended garb, wherein the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy had made us ſo dexterous, that no one living could have miſtruſted us, either by our behaviour or language.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115509:134"/>The firſt thing we did, was to inform our ſelves of the publique meeting pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the ſeveral companies that were in the City: We got acquainted with the names of the ſeveral ſtreets, and great men who then lived in the Town. But it was not long ere we ſteer'd another courſe, for as we were one day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our leſſons, I chanc'd to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a certain fair houſe, which took up my thoughts for ſome little time, and at one of the windows I beheld a young Gentlewoman, exceeding handſom, and to my apprehenſion, not above fifteen years old. Whileſt I was taking a view of her, ſhe withdrew her ſelf, and I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on my way. I turn'd to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and asked him if he took notice of the young Gentlewoman at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, yes ſaid he, I ſhould have been very ſorry not to have ſeen her, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhe is very handſom, I would to God replied I, I had not ſeen her, for the hath ſtollen my heart from me. <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi> thinking I had ſpoken in merriment,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115509:134"/>began to jeer, and to ſay, my mouth was not out of taſt, and to tell me ſhe was meat for our Maſters. Well on we went, and in concluſion home we retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It being neer Supper-time, down we ſate; but for my part, not a bit of any thing could I eat, nor hardly ſpeak a word.</p>
                  <p>When Bed time drew nigh, we reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our ſelves, yet could not I ſleep one wink; nothing but ſighs and toſſings too and fro, with the like vexations, to think that my condition hindred me from proſecuting my own inclinations. <hi>Aliſtor,</hi> who had a great kindneſs for me, ſeeing me in ſuch trouble, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to effect impoſſibilities for my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Let us firſt ſaid he, learn who and what ſhe is, and then if it be in the wit of man to win her, I'le undertake thou ſhalt wear her, however wee'l try what is to be done.</p>
                  <p>I was not ſo blinded with paſſion, but I could eaſily ſee all thoſe projects were but Chimaera's, yet I found ſome diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115509:135"/>in thinking on them. When day came, we got us into the ſame ſtreet where I had loſt both my heart and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, with intention to enquire out who that fair Goddeſs was. We were told ſhe was a rich Merchant's daughter, who was gone unto the <hi>Indies</hi> about ſix mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths before; that he had left his ſaid daughter in cuſtody of her mother, and an Uncle of hers, his Partner in trading: That her name was <hi>Rozelle,</hi> that the beſt in <hi>Seville</hi> had courted her, not only for her wealth, but her beauty. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe made me conclude my wound was mortal, and that there was no hopes of cure. But Love raiſeth the mind, and ſuggeſteth inventions, ſuch as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, could not enter into the heart of man; for we learnt withal, how a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the houſe, who always waited on the Mother and Daughter was lately dead, and that <hi>Rozelles</hi> Uncle had tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away his; whereupon we conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it would be no great matter for <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi> and my ſelf to be admitted into their
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115509:135"/>places. I acquainted him with my thoughts, and he approved of them, to effect which, we got us clothes of mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree then thoſe we then wore. Thereupon we addreſs'd our ſelves to a Taylor, who lived juſt by <hi>Rozelles</hi> houſe, we promiſed him two Peeces to get us in to ſervice there: he preſently undertook it, as thinking it eaſie to be effected, and indeed he ſo well mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this affair, that not many dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we were carried unto <hi>Rozelles</hi> Uncle who look'd upon us, and having que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd us about trivial matters, at laſt hired us, and appointed us to come the next morning.</p>
                  <p>Now for the better carrying on of our deſign, you muſt underſtand <hi>Aliſtor</hi> and I contrived together, that I ſhould wear a Millan ſhirt next under my Caſſock, with the Order of St. <hi>Jacques</hi> faſten'd to it; together with the Croſs, as the cuſtom of that Order is, vvhich might make me paſs for a Knight of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as occaſion might require. You
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115509:136"/>may imagine we were not backward to wait upon <hi>Rozelles</hi> Uncle at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, He forthwith told us what he expected from us, and put us in charge of ſuch places as were intruſted with us, in which we behaved our ſelves ſo well, that both the Uncle, Mother and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thought themſelves very happy in two ſuch good Servants. As for the reſt of the ſervants, we eaſily got their good wills by ſome ſmall liberalities, which I uſed amongſt them (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed liberality is Loves eldeſt daughter) inſomuch that I dare ſwear there was not one amongſt them that would not have ventur'd his life for us. Our money being ſtill about an hundred pounds, we intruſted with a Merchant of whom I took no Intereſt, upon condition he ſhould at any time furniſh me with Bills of Exchange for ſuch ſums as I ſhould deſire of him, not exceeding the ſaid ſum in his hands. The Merchant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of it very willingly, for that he ran no hazard, and furniſhed us with as
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:115509:136"/>many Bills as we deſired, all which he accepted, and ingaged to pay us the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, when ſoever we deſired.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon I inſinuated my ſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into one ſervant, and otherwhiles into another, and told them as a great ſecret, what Letters of Exchange I had, beſeeching them not to tell one another of it. Sometimes by means of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, I could do any thing with them. Our Merchant was a man publiquely known, which made our deſign the leſs ſuſpected; for the better carrying on of which, I would often take one or other of them along with me, and receive the money before them, which made them believe I was of other condition then I ſeem'd to be; and which moſt of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd them in that opinion, <hi>Aliſtor</hi> would now and then ſeem to reſpect me like his Maſter, when at any time we thought our ſelves alone, which he did on purpoſe to deceive them, now and then he ſtood bare-headed before me, and if I let any thing fall, as I often did, he
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115509:137"/>would preſently take it up, and deliver it to me. Now as there is not any thing a Secret which once a Servant knoweth; many dayes had not paſs'd, before my Maſter, <hi>Rozelle</hi>'s Uncle had received ſome inckling of it, as we perceived by ſome queſtions he asked us, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his deportment towards us, not that he could in the leaſt diſcover us, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then we had a mind he ſhould.</p>
                  <p>I made a good uſe of that his ſuſpition for I preſently began to court all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſerving <hi>Rozelle:</hi> If ſhe chanced to call any of the ſervants, I was ſtill ready at her elbow, which I ſo often obſerved to do, that in fine, ſhe her ſelf took notice of it.</p>
                  <p>I loſt no time, but now and then caſt amorous glances at her, which I knew how to counterfeit to an hair, having learn't it perfectly whileſt I was a Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and the truth is, I did it ſo dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, that ſhe ſeldom miſs'd of taking me at it, my eyes being never off her. It was not long ere ſhe began to obſerve
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115509:137"/>my Paſſion, and was ſo far from being any ways offended at it, that ſhe rather wiſh'd thoſe opinions conceived of my diſguiſement, had been true; and that my quality and eſtate had been corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to my behaviour and perſon. Sure I am, ſhe uſed her utmoſt Art to diſcover me; for ſhe made thoſe with whom I kept company to obſerve all my actions, in ſo much that I went no whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor ſaid I any thing, which was not preſently carried to her: Nay, ſhe once began to ſet upon <hi>Aliſtor,</hi> to try what ſhe could ſift out of him, but he was too cunning for her, and did ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly contramine her, that all ſhe could get from him was, Though my condition were at that time mean and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, yet that I had a heart and mind of a man of Honour.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Aliſtor</hi> had acquainted me with what had paſs'd between <hi>Rozele</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I reſolved by means of a Letter, which I had at my fingers ends, to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs her with a full belief, that I was the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115509:138"/>man I would fain be thought to be: My Letter being written, with a fair Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and Seal, I put it up in my Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; and one day as I paſs'd by <hi>Rozele,</hi> I took occaſion to pull out my Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and to let the Letter fall, as if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me, and ſo paſs'd on. She no ſooner ſaw me gone, but up ſhe took it, without ſpeaking one word (for ſhe ev'n long'd to know who and what I was, and and well hoped ſhe might by this Letter find the truth of it) preſently ſhe got her into her Chamber, and having look'd on the Letter ſhe found it thus Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed;</p>

                  <p>As faſt as the innocent <hi>Rozele</hi> read my Letter, ſo ſhe inſenſibly inſnar'd her ſelf
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115509:139"/>in thoſe Nets I had laid for her: Every word was a dagger at her heart, ſhe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected all my former behaviours into her thoughts, my Bils of exchange, my fellow ſervants ſuſpitions of me; and having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all together, love at laſt took full poſſeſſion of her heart; ſhe lock'd up my Letter, little thinking what pains ſhe took to undo her ſelf, and then return'd to the place where ſhe found it: At which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I took occaſion to paſs by her with the ſame reſpect I had always uſed, but with a kind of diſcontent in my face; ſhe obſerved all my behaviour, and I ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to take notice of it, began to look up and down, as if I ſought for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: At laſt, <hi>Rozele</hi> ſeeing in what a perplexity I was, asked me what I had loſt, I told her nothing, nay that cannot be, replied ſhe, for ſomething you have loſt, therefore tell me what it is; it is not worth your Ladyſhips knowing, nor my looking, I replied unto her; thus, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to regard it; but I ſo well acted it, that ſhe perceived I was much
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115509:140"/>troubled at it, ſo that poor <hi>Rozele</hi> was half in the mind to have reſtored me my Letter; but in the interim, ſome ſtrangers knock'd at the door, which made her withdraw and leave me there alone.</p>
                  <p>I preſently got me unto <hi>Aliſter,</hi> and gave him an account of what had paſſed, who concluded our deſign went on very proſperouſly. From that time <hi>Rozele</hi> made me perceive ſhe had as much paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for me, as I for her: If at any time ſhe called for any thing, <hi>Palinte</hi> was the man (for that was the name I had aſſumed when firſt I came into the houſe) All her pleaſure and delight was to talk with me, and to command me, and all my joy was to ſee and obey her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rozel</hi>'s Mother was not over heedful in watching of her Daughter, but would oftentimes leave her at whom, when as her ſelf went abroad, either to take the air, or to her devotions, being well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured I ſuppoſe, of her Daughters diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:115509:140"/>
                  <p>Now it hapned upon a cetain day, that the good Mother was gone abroad, and in the interim I came in from the Town. <hi>Aliſtor</hi> came and opened the door, and withal told me, that <hi>Rozelle</hi> was left at home alone, that ſhe had call'd for me two or three times, and that he thought ſhe then was in the room over the Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, to watch my coming in. You raviſh me, ſaid I, with this good newes, but however let us firſt go to our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, before I go to her, for one of my ſleeves is torn, and had need be repair'd. In we went, and I perceiv'd <hi>Rozelle</hi> looking into the Hall through a lettice-window, yet I took no notice of it, but went on directly to our Chamber to ſhut the door, <hi>Aliſtor</hi> help'd me off with my Doublet, and I ſate me down in a chair, for the truth is, I was weary with vval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. I had then on my Naples ſhirt, vvith the Order of St. <hi>Jacques</hi> upon it vvrought all with Cold and Silk, very rich, and being in this poſture, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſome body at the door, looking
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:115509:141"/>in through the key hole; at which inſtant I gave <hi>Aliſtor</hi> the ſignal agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our ſelves, at which he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect me as occaſion ſhould require: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he was uncover'd, and ſtanding by me, I began to talk in this manner unto him. <hi>Aliſtor,</hi> I have had ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of thy fidelity and valor; nor art thou unacquainted with the paſſion and ſervice I have vowed unto <hi>Rozele,</hi> which however I dare not diſcover unto her, no more then my Quality, until ſuch time as my affairs are in a better poſture. Notwithſtanding I am much perplex'd leaſt in the interim, I might be inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in her affection to my prejudice; for I am reſolved to have a paſt or two with ſome of thoſe Gallants, who are ever and anon expreſſing their paſſions, either in Muſique, or Verſes, at her Window: The truth is, I can no longer endure it, I muſt and will ſet them further off, which I beleeve might be done without any noiſe, for that no one will ſuſpect it is any of the houſe.</p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:115509:141"/>
                  <p>I had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but up I roſe, and walking very ſoberly over the Chamber, I gave <hi>Rozele</hi> time enough to retire from the door, for I verily beleeved it was ſhe, knowing of what an inquiſitive diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe was.</p>
                  <p>She who had heard all my diſcourſe, and was not a little alarm'd at it; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſent one to call me, intending by ſome way or other, to divert me from the deſign I pretended to have: I put on my clothes and followed her into the Garden whether ſhe went: I waited on her with the ſame reſpect I had always uſed; She ſate down on a green Bank, and commanded me to ſit by her: I made my excuſes unto her in the beſt tearms I could, I told her I was both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed and confuſed, at the great honor ſhe did me, but that I could not withal forget my condition: You may do as you pleaſe, <hi>Signeur Don Fernand,</hi> ſaid ſhe, for you are of a condition to command where ever you are: Oh God! ſaid I, with a great ſigh, and fetching two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:115509:142"/>backward, as in a fright; no, no, ſaid ſhe, all that ſerves now for nothing, you are diſcovered, we know who you are, notwithſtanding all your inventions; but we have great cauſe to complain of you for concealing your ſelf ſo long, by which means we have been deficient in paying thoſe reſpects due to your Quality, but ſeeing it is a fault of your own, we hope you will excuſe it in us.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt ſhe was ſtill talking, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſurpriſed with her diſcourſe: Mean you me <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid I? Yet Sir, your ſelf: Look, look you there's that which hath diſcovered you, ſee the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you loſt t'other day, for which you looked ſo up and down, and with that gave me the Letter: I received it, ſhrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging my ſhoulders, and confeſſed it truth; After ſeveral Complements, ſhe intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to tell her the occaſion of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, whereupon I told her a Tale which I had at my fingers ends; and had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſerv'd my turn to put a trick upon <hi>Annetta</hi> my Hoſteſſes Daughter. Your
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115509:142"/>Ladyſhip may be pleaſed to underſtand that I ſerv'd a Lady of the Court, more out of Gallantry then any good will; Now one of the greateſt Knights of <hi>Spain</hi> made addreſſes to her at the ſame time, and although he was a perſon of great honour and worth, yet could he not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any kindneſs from her, yet was ſhe very free of her favours to me who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd them not, in regard I did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affect her: The Knight became jealous of me, and having his ſpies abroad, took me one night as I as diſcourſing with her at her Window; he preſently fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and though in himſelf a very ſtout man, and well attended; yet it was his misfortune to fall dead on the place; His death ſo diſmayed his attendants, that they forſook the body, and left <hi>Aliſtor</hi> and my ſelf maſters of the field. Now he being, as I told you, a perſon of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and one whoſe death the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented: I was forced for the better eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the hands of Juſtice, and ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries as I knew would be laid out, to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115509:143"/>diſguiſe my ſelf as your Ladyſhip now ſees. I had not been above two days in this City, before it was my chance to paſs by this houſe, at which time you were then ſtanding in a Window, where you appeared to be ſuch as you really are, a moſt incomparable Creature: From that moment I found my ſelf a ſlave, and my liberty quite loſt, in ſo much that I could not live out of your preſence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I had recourſe unto all thoſe inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which love ſuggeſted unto me to eaſe my paſſions, and at laſt found means to be admitted as a ſervant into the houſe, for which happineſs I ſhould be ever thankful; and that although peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the rigor of the Law I might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be permitted to enjoy ſo great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yet I ſhould ever think my ſelf dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, by having been ſervant to ſo fair a Miſtreſs. Without this device I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come neer you, but had dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of help; for my quality would have kept you on your Guard; the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious part of woing would have crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115509:143"/>a thouſand obſtructions to my undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and which was more, my life had been indanger'd, for that probably Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice might have found me out and ſeiz'd on me, at leaſt forc'd me from that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: That then my life's remedy would have been worſe then death, for I muſt then have quitted the ſight of your ſelf, which is the worſt of deaths. My only deſign was to wait on you, until ſuch time as my friends might have appeas'd his Majeſties anger, that then I might have acquainted you with my name and extraction, but ſeeing Heaven hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me, and diſcovered me unto you, I have likewiſe taken the boldneſs to let you know the truth of my love, and do beſeech and conjure you to accept of my heart, my honour, and whatever wealth I have in the world.</p>
                  <p>You may eaſily perſwade your ſelves I wanted no ſighs to ſet off my diſcourſe: for the truth is, I was very much in love: <hi>Rozelle</hi> heard me with ſuch effective de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of paſſion that it was not
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115509:144"/>without ſome regret I deceived her as I did. Sir, ſaid ſhe, if your paſſion be but as true as you have lively repreſented it, I may then repute my ſelf the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt perſon living of my condition, when I find my ſelf courted by a perſon of your quality: and to let you ſee how much I am inclin'd to pleaſe you, I ſhall take upon me to let you know, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of your deſires ſhall be only li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the time in which you intend to demand me of my Mother and Uncle, unto whom my Father hath give full power to do as he ſeeth fit in ſuch affairs, and therewithal roſes appeared in her cheeks, which with their Vermillian tincture infinitely increaſed her beauty, and added new fuel to my flames.</p>
                  <p>When I ſaw <hi>Rozelle</hi> at the point I ſo much deſired, I intreated her to acquaint her Mother with my condition and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that no longer time might be loſt, and that then I would manage the reſt as I ſaw occaſion. In the midſt of our diſcourſe in came her Mother; <hi>Rozelle</hi>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:115509:144"/>as impatient as my ſelf, preſently went to wait upon her, and made her an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple recital of what had paſs'd, who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with the relation of me, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſought for her brother in Law, to let him know my diſcovery, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what excuſes they ſhould make to me, for not having treated me according to my degree. The Brother in Law was of opinion, that at night when I was retired to my Chamber, they ſhould come and proffer their ſervice to me, and beg my excuſe of their ignorance. They did ſo, and ſo from that very minute, from a Servant I was declared a Maſter, and lodged in a very fair rich Chamber. Theſe Ceremonies thus paſs'd, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched them not to diſcourſe any thing of me unto their friends and kindred, or indeed to call me by my own name.</p>
                  <p>I paſs'd in this manner about a month after my Metamorphoſis from a Servant to a Knight, during which time I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved divers honours from <hi>Rozelles</hi> Moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Uncle, and from her ſelf many
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115509:145"/>civil favours. Her own converſe and the reſpect I bore unto her, made me perfectly civil; inſomuch that I never attempted or requeſted any thing from her, which was not modeſt and lawful, to the end I might not infringe the Laws of Hoſpitality; which deportment of mine did much confirm both them and her in their opinions of my perſonated Nobility. But in fine, fearing leſt ſome ill Spirit might riſe to deſtroy the ſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of my good fortune which I had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſuch a height, I one day pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have received a Letter from a friend of mine at the Court, wherein I was inform'd, that it had pleaſed his Majeſty to grant me his free pardon to return home, and that I was of neceſſity to go unto <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> where the Court then was, to give thanks unto the King. At this Newes all the family ſeem'd to rejoyce, eſpecially poor <hi>Rozelle,</hi> ſo much were they intereſted in my affairs. Then I began to look wiſely about me, and carried my ſelf very gravely, I told them
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115509:145"/>I could not better acknowledg the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and obligations I had receiv'd from them, then by contracting an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them, and to pay the reſpects I owed them, by marrying their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Rozelle.</hi> I had ſo ſooner declared that my intention, but the Uncle and Mother ſuſpecting leſt it might be but a copy of my countenance, preſently took me at my word, without asking any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their friends or kindred, or far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquiry into my quality or eſtate, ſo that they preſently got a Licence from the Biſhop, and we were married with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking of our Banes. Thus did I ſatisfie my paſſion, and ſetled my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, for which I was proffered five thouſand pounds certain, beſides what might come by ſucceſſion from her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; Mother, whoſe only child ſhe was.</p>
                  <p>When I ſaw my ſelf in poſſeſſion of ſo hand ſom a woman, and ſo good a fortune, I reſolved to turn wiſe in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the management of my eſtate, and honeſt, in relation to the obligations I
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115509:146"/>owed unto <hi>Rozelle.</hi> In this deſign I conſulted with <hi>Aliſtor,</hi> as alſo how we might retire from <hi>Seville,</hi> and carry my wife with us, for we concluded it abſolutely expedient to take her off from her Mother, leſt time might make a diſcovery of us, and ſo ſhe might make friends to force both her daughter and fortune out of my hands. After ſundry debates it was concluded that <hi>Aliſtor</hi> ſhould go before unto <hi>Vaillandolid,</hi> with ſuch money as we had left, and that he ſhould hire a houſe, and furniſh it the beſt he could.</p>
                  <p>This was put in execution, and when I had received notice of it, I endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to perſwade <hi>Rozelles</hi> Mother and Uncle, that it was convenient for me to carry my wife unto <hi>Vailladolid</hi> to bring her acquainted with my friends, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Duke of—my Brother, that her beauty might plead my excuſe, for having married one beneath their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>Both Uncle and Mother thought it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115509:146"/>reaſonable, whereupon we conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together that <hi>Rozelles</hi> five thouſand pounds ſhould be paid in unto ſome Merchant who ſhould return it unto <hi>Vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladolid,</hi> which was accordingly effected. And for the better carrying on of my diſguiſe, I deſired the Uncle would be pleaſed to take care of the Bills, for that he intended to go along with us, partly to accompany his Neece, and partly to underſtand my eſtate and condition. It was not long ere <hi>Rozelle</hi> took leave of her Mother, unto whom I promiſed to bring her daughter back within two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, at leaſt to come and wait on her to her daughters houſe and eſtate.</p>
                  <p>We took our leaves and came to <hi>Vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladolid,</hi> we alighted at the houſe <hi>Aliſtor</hi> had hir'd for me, which to ſay the truth, was wel provided with furniture and the like: The ſame night I profeſſed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of love and kind neſs unto <hi>Rozele,</hi> and in fine, I made her acquainted with the whole naked truth, and what means I had uſed to obtain her: At firſt ſhe was
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115509:167"/>much aſtoniſhed at it, but the affection ſhe bore me, was ſuch, and I had gotten ſuch an aſcendant over her, that ſhe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not any the leaſt diſcontent at it, but reſolutely taught me how I might get the reſt of her Portion which was ſtill in her Unckles hands.</p>
                  <p>You muſt not by any means, ſaid ſhe, let my Uncle ſmell out your deceit before you have made ſure of the Bills which are in his cuſtody; but go to him betimes in the morning, before he be ſtirring, and and then tell him your Brother and you have bin at words concerning your Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which he miſtruſteth you have made up, more out of paſſion then reaſon; and that he upbraideth you with my meanneſs and poverty; and that you hope to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him of the contrary: Firſt by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the Bills of exchange; and then by carrying me to him, by which means he may be perſwaded it was not only my Beauty or perfections which ingaged you but alſo my portion and fortune: I am confident he will not refuſe you, becauſe
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115509:147"/>the pretence is very fair and ſpecious; however be ſure you and <hi>Aliſtor</hi> have your Swords by your ſides, wherewith to force him, if need be, which may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be done, ſeeing he is in your own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; The next thing you do, is to go to the Merchant upon whom the Bills are charged, and get him preſently to accept them.</p>
                  <p>I admired at the ſubtilty and quickneſs of her wit; I kiſſed her over and over, a thouſand times, and at laſt went to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute what ſhe had adviſed, in which I ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded very happily: Her Uncle did not ſcruple the Bills, the Merchant accepted them, and paid us five hundred pound upon content. I gave <hi>Rozele</hi> an account of it, who ſeemed overjoyed; her Uncle all this while knew not one ſyllable of what had paſſed; and when he preſs'd me to bring him unto the Earl my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I told him he was a humor ſome man, and one that I muſt ſooth up, to work out my own ends, and that in a day or two I doubted not of finding him in a
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:115509:148"/>good mood. Thus I put him off from day to day, until at laſt he received news from my Mother in Law, that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was caſt away coming from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and that his preſence would be neceſſary at home, to ſettle affairs in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>When he had received this ſad news for him, though joyful for me, I could not for my life ſtop him one day longer, but away he would for <hi>Seville;</hi> In fine, he took leave of us, as ignorant of my affairs as ever.</p>
                  <p>At his arrival at <hi>Seville,</hi> he found my Mother in Law very ſick, what for the loſs of her Husband, and abſence of her Daughter, in ſo much that ſhe followed her Husband in a few days, making me ſenſible of the truth of the Spaniſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Dulce es la muerte de ſuegra; A Mother in Laws death is as ſweet as Harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chocks and Peaſe;</hi> for ſhe left me in <hi>Rozeles</hi> right, the Inheritance, and Goods of her houſe, which amounted unto one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Crowns.</p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:115509:148"/>
                  <p>Having thus fixed and ſetled my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune by <hi>Aliſtors</hi> help and conduct, it was but reaſonable to make him ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and reward, for the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had done me; whereupon I gave him a thouſand pounds, wherewith he reſted very wel contented, and ſo went off from me.</p>
                  <p>Thus Gentle Reader you have ſeen the iſſue of my adventures; but for as much as no one can be called happy before his death, I know not whether amidſt ſo many good fortunes, ſome diſaſter may not intervean, which may force me to eat ſower meat for my ſweet ſawce, and ſo compel me to end my laſt Act like my firſt.</p>
                  <p>Every thing is in the hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we cannot foreſee what ſhall be after us; yet for the preſent I think I may ſafely ſay, there are few men in the world, who for happineſs may compare with my ſelf. I wiſh the Heavens long to continue it in the company of my dear <hi>Rozele.</hi>

                  <head>The daily exerciſe to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Knights of this Order, for the keeping of their money, when any one ſhall ask of them by way of <hi>Gift,</hi> which word is of more terror to them then death it ſelf.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt of all, He ſhall at his upriſing in the morning, make the ſign of the Croſs upon his Purſe; in the next place upon his Perſon, that he may repel all ſuch evil ſpirits as might form any petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary actions to his prejudice.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, He ſhall devoutly pronounce theſe words: <hi>I do ſtedfaſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115509:151"/>and vow, neither to give, lend, or promiſe any thing whatever, either in thought word or deed:</hi> Then he ſhall recommend himſelf unto his Angel Gardian, as the Patron of his Order.</p>
                  <p>This done, he ſhall go hear maſs, as being thereunto obliged, though it be a working day; for as much as all days are unto him to be kept as Holy-days, and that he may not think any a working day, but that whereon he is obliged, conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or forc'd to give.</p>
                  <p>At night whileſt he is putting off his clothes to go to bed, he ſhall give thanks unto God, for having given him the grace to take off his own clothes, and that another doth it not for him; By this means he ſhall ſleep ſoundly, unleſs the Lice or Fleas chance to awake him.</p>
                  <p>When any one comes to viſit him, of what Quality ſoever he be, after the firſt complements paſs'd, he ſhall take ſome occaſion to uſe theſe or the like words by way of prevention: <hi>Me thinks the whole world is going down the wind, for there are
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:115509:151"/>few men now adayes, who have ſo much as ten pound in ready money by them.</hi> Next he ſhall proffer his ſervice and aſſiſtance, for thoſe precautionary words will do ſtrange feats, in ſtriking dumb the moſt brazen Borrowers.</p>
                  <p>In caſe it ſhould ſo fall out that our Knight be prevented, and the queſtion put to him before he could uſe the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Antidote, he ſhall then forthwith reply, Alas Sir, I was juſt coming unto you to have begg'd the like favour of you, for that I have a ſmall affair in hand, which elſe will utterly undo me.</p>
                  <p>If he be in any company where ſome one or other may peradventure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Ring, Sword, Watch, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe of his, upon deſign to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a proffer of it, Sir, our Knights muſt preſently reply, I ſhall hereafter have a greater eſteem for it then ever, ſeeing it hath deſerv'd your commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Moreover he ought to be like the Trumpet, which ſounds the charge on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:115509:152"/>never the <hi>Give fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ought to have that Term of haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, <hi>Hold well,</hi> alwayes imprinted in his memory.</p>
                  <p>In caſe he underſtand not the Latine tongue, but hath a deſire to learn it, he may be permitted to decline the word <hi>Accipio,</hi> but not <hi>Dono.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The uſe of any Proverb, but <hi>Safe bind, ſafe find,</hi> is utterly forbidden him.</p>
                  <p>As alſo the uſe of any of theſe words <hi>Free-gift, White-gift,</hi> or any of the like termination, in regard of the laſt ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which ought to be had in great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation by all of this Order.</p>
                  <p>Nor may our Knights ſo much as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to lend any thing more then his ear, or attention, and not that neither, but unto pleaſant ſounds.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly he ought to remember, how many have miſcarried for want of the retentive faculty: That a demand is like a blow on the mouth or the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, for it takes away the ſpeech. With theſe obſervations, he may live contentedly until he die.</p>

                     <p>HOw <hi>Joan,</hi> what Caſuiſt is it that hath read thee this ſevere Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture? What mortification hath ſince yeſterday betide thee? In good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, as often as I read over the Letter I receiv'd from you this morning, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether or no I do not dream, or whether I am in my own ſenſes: You tell me it is a holy ſeaſon, and that your neighbors grumble that your Mother and Aunt do bait you day and night; Your Siſter falls out with you upon my ſcore; and at laſt you remonſtrate unto me, that I could not imagine our pleaſures would always laſt: Then you deſcend, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to forbear coming more unto you, and tell me, it is but reaſonable to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſome part of our lives unto God. Prethee <hi>Joan</hi> what's the meaning of all this? Is the Devil turn'd Frier? to what end doeſt thou treat me with ſuch a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115509:154"/>after thou haſt ſuck'd out the laſt drop of my blood, eaten me to the very bones, and conſumed the quinteſſence of my Purſe: Ah wicked Girle that thou art; whileſt I had wherewithal to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the exceſs of your debauches, then you could never tell me the ſeaſon was holy, or that the neighbors took notice of you: Then not a word of that accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Mother of yours: Oh how comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was that damn'd Aunt of thine, and that Devil thy Siſter, as long as my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney laſted: Ah God knows how I have ſupplyed their neceſſities? I have often thought upon it, when I ſaw my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you four, I verily conceited my ſelf to be between two Armies ready to give battel, or in a Clock Cage, whileſt the Alarum was ringing, for I could hear nothing on one ſide, but Give on, give on, give on, give on; and on the t'other ſide nothing but Give me, give me, give me: But a preſent I thank my neceſſity; for ſhe it is that delivers me from all thoſe terrors: and who of Bawds and Whores,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115509:155"/>that you were, hath made you turn Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents; ſo that when I regard my empty Purſe, I am ſometimes intending to ſend you the ſtrings of it for a Diſcipline: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally I cannot forbear laughing, when I reflect on thoſe words of yours: That we ought to dedicate the ſmall remainder of our lives unto God; whereas I prethee to whom canſt thou more lawfully devote them unto <hi>Lucifer.</hi> As for that your requeſt of my not coming to you any more, I give you my word you ſhall find me very exact in obeying it, for I am not ſo uncivil as not to obſerve your directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in that perticular as command.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude with giving you a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good advice, in caſe you be truely ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the remorſe of your conſcience, and that you really intend to be a convert: You muſt then think of making me ſome reſtitution of the unjuſt gain you have made of me; By this means you may probably win me to follow your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to repent my paſs'd life: As for the reſt, we ſhall ſue each other in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,

But to return to your diſcourſe, I conceive by
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115509:158"/>the nature of your requeſt, you were thereunto carried rather out of revenge, then any deſire of my race; and for Cods ſake tell me, what have I ever committed, which could entice thee to deſign ſo great a miſchief againſt me?

I am a poor ſhame-fac'd Lover, one who dare not diſcover my infirmitie, but unto ſuch well diſpoſed perſons as your ſelf. Unto you then I have preſumed to make my addreſſes, for eaſing of my pain. In caſe you have a mind to do me any good office, I prethee <hi>Lamia</hi> let it be done in the night, at leaſt in ſuch a place, where none but your ſelf may know my indigencies, for that is the only true way of exerciſing Charitie indeed.</p>

Why pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee <hi>Afrania,</hi> it is not enough that you eat me out in the Dinners and Suppers, but you muſt alſo devour me in Collations, and fiddle faddles? Hereafter learn and denie your ſelf thoſe ſuperfluous Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, and faſt for the expiation of your ſins. It is now a full year, two months, three days, and one hour and half, that you have eat upon my accompt, not only you, but two of your aſſoſciates, your

But notwithſtanding all theſe
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:115509:161"/>commendations of mine, of which I ſhall and muſt be very liberal in your behalf; yet give me leave to tell you, that had you laid out in ſtuff all the money which it coſt you in Paper, Ink and Wax, Silk to ſeal your Letters, and ſmall pence for your Porters, you had eaſed me of a grand trouble, and had not ſo unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thrown away thoſe flowers of your flouriſhing ſoul: However, I ſtill forbear to ſend it unto you, in regard it would now ſeem rather extorted then given: I beſeech you therefore reſt contented with my acknowledgments of the perfections, and with the praiſe which I ſhall ever pay unto your worth.</p>

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:115509:162"/>you are, and evidently confirmed unto me that you are the moſt fickle of all men: Had I when you firſt haunted me, beleeved my friends, you had not now had the trouble of hearing my complaints againſt your treachery. However, I ſhall not want either courage or occaſions of revenging my ſelf; I am told you have met with a good fortune, and becauſe I know her, I cannot but admire at your great judgment: I adviſe you therefore to knock out of her as many as you can: I aſſure you I ſhall do the like, in hopes of making ſome as good as your ſelf.</p>

I am equally ſorry with you, that you did not beleeve your Mother and Aunt, at the firſt time of our acquaintance; I wiſh you had, for thereby we might both of us have been great gainers, but eſpecially my ſelf: for their ſake hereafter, thus, if I chance to make love unto any one, it ſhall be my firſt enquirie what relations my Miſtreſs hath, for indeed I had much rather ſhe were a kin to the French diſeaſe then ſuch a Mother and Aunt: The firſt is now a daies eaſilie cured, but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond mortals, ſo cankerous they are, that indeed they eat the very ſtrings of ones Purſe: The fear of that is the thing which hath made your houſe odious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
